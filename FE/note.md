Hey guys, here are some brief notes about the front-end codes.

# 1. How to run?

"npm install" to install all modules and "npm start" to run this project

# 2. Structure

all main codes are in src repository, it contains 

* assets (all static resource, image files, icons)
* Components (sign in/ sign up and TopBar)
* Http (basic axios configuration, look through axios documentation if you need)
* Pages
* Router

# 3. How to get data from backend?

In this part, you could use axios or whatever method you like. I have finished all the front-end layout and functions. You need to finish the data part. 

If you choose to use axios, here is the [axios documentation](https://github.com/axios/axios)
