hey guys youll be reading this while i am probably asleep
i converted the database into something usable and have filled it with a little bit 
of random data.

the nodes.js is the only script that we need to be able to run everything
but i will need some help updating the index.js for each of the particular 
things that we need to do. rn i have to manually type in the urls 

what we need to do its run this command onclick -- i am struggling to understand
how to keep functionality while adding this.

command:
fetch(https://localhost:3000/register/add?username=____user_username____&password=___our_password____

this is the hard part of it. in the messenger ill send the youtube video i used to kind of understand what to do and that should make it a little easier to understand

the only thing left to do is convert the webpages into something that calls that fetch command that runs the command then returns -- this is how we will update/delete/insert
