The diversity of symptoms, the alterations in common pathophysiology, the existence of asymptomatic cases, the different types of sporadic and familial Alzheimer's and their relevance with other types of dementia and comorbidities, have already created a myth-fear against the leading disease of the twenty first century. Many failed latest clinical trials and novel medications have revealed the early diagnosis as the most critical treatment solution, even though scientists tested the amyloid hypothesis and few related drugs. Unfortunately, latest studies have indicated that the disease begins at the very young ages thus making it difficult to determine the right time of proper treatment. By taking into consideration all these multivariate aspects and unreliable factors against an appropriate treatment, we focused our research on a non-classic statistical evaluation of the most known and accepted Alzheimer's biomarkers. Therefore, in this paper, the code and few experimental results of a computational Bayesian tool have being reported, dedicated to the correlation and assessment of several Alzheimer's biomarkers to export a probabilistic medical prognostic process.

Methods.: Patients aged 60 years and older received delayed tacrolimus with basiliximab and mycophenolate mofetil with early steroid discontinuation (Tac-d, n=132) or standard tacrolimus with mycophenolate mofetil and steroids until day 91 (Tac-s, n=122). Tacrolimus trough levels were 5 to 10 ng/mL after day 43 in both groups. Renal function at month 6 was measured by calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault formula). Results.: In both groups, mean recipient age was 66 years, mean donor age was 63 years with 73% of donors aged 60 years and older. Steroid discontinuation was slower than protocol specified.

Consequently, the limited LTE coverage will result in many inter-radio access technology (RAT) handovers from LTE to 3G systems and vice versa. Trouble-free operation of inter-RAT handovers requires the optimization of the handover parameters of each cell in both RATs. The current network planning and optimization methods provide a fixed network-wide setting for all the handover parameters of the cells. Cells that later show considerable mobility problems in operation mode are manually optimized with the aid of drive tests and expert knowledge. This manual optimization of the handover parameters requires permanent human intervention and increases the operational expenditure (OPEX) of the mobile operators. Moreover, the interoperability of several RATs increases further the parameter space of the handover parameters, which makes the manual optimization difficult and almost impracticable. To reduce OPEX and to achieve a better network performance, we propose in this paper a self-optimizing algorithm where each cell in a RAT updates its handover parameters in an autonomous and automated manner depending on its traffic and mobility conditions. The proposed algorithm uses a feedback controller to update the handover parameters as a means to providing a steady improvement in the network performance. In the context of control theory, the feedback controller consists of a proportional control block, which regulates the change in the magnitude of each handover parameter, and a gain scheduler, which modifies the parameters of the proportional control block depending on the mobility conditions in each cell. To benchmark the design of the proposed algorithm, we apply two general and nonself-optimization algorithms: Taguchi's method and simulated annealing to optimize the handover parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed self-optimizing algorithm reaches a stable optimized operation point with cell-specific handover parameter settings, which considerably reduce the number of mobility failure events in the network, compared with three fixed settings for the handover parameters. Moreover, it is presented that the proposed self-optimizing algorithm outperforms Taguchi's method and simulated annealing when applied to a mobility robustness optimization (MRO) problem.", "title": "A SON-Based Algorithm for the Optimization of Inter-RAT Handover Parameters", "id": 4}, {"journal": "Fluid Phase Equilibria", "authors": ["A.

However, to determine an accurate distribution, tremendous field efforts are often required. Traditionally, the grain size distribution of channel beds have been obtained by manually counting a set of randomly selected stones (the \u201cpebble count\u201d). Based on this elementary principle, many authors have proposed different adaptations to overcome weaknesses and problems with the original method; with the development of digital technology, photographic methods have been developed in order to significantly reduce the time spent in the field.

In this study, AGS and MPS were applied under ideal laboratory conditions, to be used as reference, and in two field conditions with different degrees of difficulty in terms of visual determination of the grain size distribution; these included an artificial unlined channel and two natural mountainous streams. The results were compared with those obtained with the pebble-count method. In general, strong agreement between the methods was found when they were applied under favorable conditions (\u201dthe laboratory\u201d), and the differences between the image-assisted and pebble count methods were similar to those found in previous studies. Despite being more time consuming, MPS was deemed preferable to AGS when conditions are not optimal; in these cases, the time spent on image elaboration significantly increased in the AGS method (approximately three-fold), but the estimation error of the median grain size decreased by approximately 37%. The use of image-assisted analysis has proven to be robust for characterizing sediment in watercourse beds and reducing fieldwork time, but because field conditions can significantly affect the accuracy of results, the method choice must be carefully considered.", "title": "A comparison between different methods for determining grain distribution in coarse channel beds", "id": 6}, {"journal": "Developmental Psychology", "authors": ["A.

A prospective randomized controlled trial of OSA patients with morbid obesity was conducted. Eighty patients were randomized into two groups: 38 received conservative treatment and 42 received CPAP treatment for 12 weeks. Plasma levels of BCAA, glucose tolerance and insulin resistance were evaluated at baseline and after treatment. After treatment, significant decreases of leucine levels were observed in both groups when compared with baseline levels (P < 0.005). With respect to patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) had higher baseline levels of isoleucine (78 \u00b1 16 versus 70 \u00b1 13 \u03bcmol L\u22121, P = 0.014) and valine (286 \u00b1 36 versus 268 \u00b1 41 \u03bcmol L\u22121, P = 0.049), respectively. Changes in levels of leucine and isoleucine after treatment were related negatively to changes in fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin values only in the conservative group (P < 0.05). In summary, we found that the treatment with CPAP for 12 weeks caused similar changes in circulating BCAAs concentrations to conservative treatment and a differential metabolic response of CPAP and conservative treatment was observed between the relationship of BCAAs and glucose homeostasis.

In this paper, the seismic performance of such slopes in non-liquefiable granular soils is considered, focusing on permanent movement and dynamic motion at the crest, which would form key inputs into the aseismic design of supported infrastructure. In contrast to previous studies, the evolution of this behaviour under multiple sequential strong ground motions is studied through dynamic centrifuge, numerical (finite-element, FE) and analytical (sliding-block) modelling, the centrifuge tests being used to validate the two non-physical approaches. The FE models focus on the specification of model parameters for existing non-linear constitutive models using routine site investigation data, allowing them to be used routinely in design and analysis. Soil-specific constitutive parameters are derived from shearbox and oedometer test data, and are found to significantly outperform existing empirical correlations based on relative density, highlighting the importance of specifying a suitably detailed site investigation. An improved sliding-block (\u2018Newmark') approach is also developed for estimating permanent deformations during preliminary design, in which the formulation of the yield acceleration is fully strain-dependent, incorporating both material hardening/softening and geometric hardening (re-grading). The site-specific (improved) FE models and the new sliding-block approach are shown to outperform considerably existing FE parameters and sliding-block models in capturing the permanent deformations of the slope under virgin conditions, and further, only the improved FE and sliding-block models are found to capture correctly the behaviour of the \u2018damaged' slope under subsequent earthquakes (e.g. strong aftershocks). The FE models can additionally accurately replicate the settlement profile at the crest and quantify the dynamic motions that would be input to supported structures, although these were generally overpredicted.

However, the fluctuations of the fuel price and the vulnerability of crude oil sources have increased the interest of the aviation industry in alternate energy sources. The motivation of this interest is actually twofold: firstly, alternative fuels will help to stabilize price fluctuations by relieving the worldwide demand for conventional fuel. Secondly, alternative fuels could provide environmental benefits including a substantial reduction of emitted CO2 over the fuel life cycle. Thus, the ideal alternative fuel will fulfill both requirements: relieve the demand for fuels derived from crude oil and significantly reduce CO2 emissions. In the present paper, the effects of various alternative fuels on the operation of a medium transport/utility helicopter are investigated using performance models of the helicopter and its associated turboshaft engine. These models are developed in an object-oriented simulation environment that allows a direct mechanical connection to be established between them in order to create an integrated model. Considering the case of a typical mission for the specific helicopter/engine combination, a comparative evaluation of conventional and alternative fuels is then carried out and performance results are presented at both engine and helicopter levels.", "title": "Assessing Alternative Fuels for Helicopter Operation", "id": 38}, {"journal": "IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems", "authors": ["A.

Moreover, their design requires tools aimed at understanding the integration of refugees despite the complexity of this phenomenon. In this work, we propose a set of metrics aimed at providing insights and assessing the integration of Syrian refugees, by analyzing a real-world call detail record (CDR) dataset including calls from refugees and locals in Turkey throughout 2017. Specifically, we exploit the similarity between refugees\u2019 and locals\u2019 spatial and temporal behaviors, in terms of communication and mobility in order to assess integration dynamics. Together with the already known methods for data analysis, we use a novel computational approach to analyze spatio-temporal patterns: computational stigmergy, a bio-inspired scalar and temporal aggregation of samples. Computational stigmergy associates each sample with a virtual pheromone deposit (mark). Marks in spatiotemporal proximity are aggregated into functional structures called trails, which summarize the spatiotemporal patterns in data and allow computing the similarity between different patterns. According to our results, collective mobility and behavioral similarity with locals have great potential as measures of integration, since they are: 1) correlated with the amount of interaction with locals; 2) an effective proxy for refugee\u2019s economic capacity, and thus refugee\u2019s potential employment; and 3) able to capture events that may disrupt the integration phenomena, such as social tension.", "title": "Assessing Refugees' Integration via Spatio-Temporal Similarities of Mobility and Calling Behaviors", "id": 39}, {"journal": "The Anatomical Record", "authors": ["A.

A disinhibited personality construct was measured using the following personality scales: Sensation Seeking, Aggression-Hostility, Psychoticism, Sensitivity to Reward, Novelty Seeking and Impulsivity. A factor analysis of the six scales provided a normalized z index that was taken as a measure of impulsive-disinhibited personality . Results: Our data show that inmates carrying CAG short and GGN long haplotype group (short\u2013long haplotype) obtained higher scores on all personality scales. Differences were found for the Impulsive Sensation-Seeking scale (age-adjusted multivariate analysis, P <0.016) and z index ( P <0.036).

In fact, the MHC complex remains one of the best-known examples of natural selection in humans, with well-established genetic signatures and biological mechanisms for the action of selection. Here, we present genetic and functional evidence that another gene with a fundamental role in MHC class I presentation, endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2), has also evolved under balancing selection and contains a variant that affects antigen presentation. Specifically, genetic analyses of six human populations revealed strong and consistent signatures of balancing selection affecting ERAP2. This selection maintains two highly differentiated haplotypes (Haplotype A and Haplotype B), with frequencies 0.44 and 0.56, respectively. We found that ERAP2 expressed from Haplotype B undergoes differential splicing and encodes a truncated protein, leading to nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA. To investigate the consequences of ERAP2 deficiency on MHC presentation, we correlated surface MHC class I expression with ERAP2 genotypes in primary lymphocytes. Haplotype B homozygotes had lower levels of MHC class I expressed on the surface of B cells, suggesting that naturally occurring ERAP2 deficiency affects MHC presentation and immune response. Interestingly, an ERAP2 paralog, endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), also shows genetic signatures of balancing selection. Together, our findings link the genetic signatures of selection with an effect on splicing and a cellular phenotype. Although the precise selective pressure that maintains polymorphism is unknown, the demonstrated differences between the ERAP2 splice forms provide important insights into the potential mechanism for the action of selection.", "title": "Balancing Selection Maintains a Form of ERAP2 that Undergoes Nonsense-Mediated Decay and Affects Antigen Presentation", "id": 47}, {"journal": "Journal of Experimental Biology", "authors": ["A.

As far as we know, this is the first time that a host signal has beenshown to be repellent for a haematophagous insect. The response to heat isalso modulated but no repellence was observed. When blood was replaced bysaline solution as food, a significant reduction of the response to bothsignals was evinced but repellence was not observed. The injection ofhaemolymph from fed insects into starved insects inhibited the response of thereceiver insects to both signals but this was not observed after the injectionof saline solution or of haemolymph from non-fed insects.

The new model RC allows these factors to be properly accounted for in a reduced-scale physical model for the first time. Two different reinforcement layouts were considered, representing (1) a section specifically detailed to carry the bending moments induced by the slipping soil mass, and (2) a nominally reinforced section with low moment capacity. These were supported by further tests on conventional elastic piles that were instrumented to measure seismic soil-pile interaction. It was demonstrated that dynamic ground motions at the crest can be significantly reduced in amplitude by up to 20% with elastic piles spaced at s/B=3.5, both in terms of the peak acceleration and across the full response spectrum. Permanent deformations at the slope crest (e.g., settlement) were also reduced by up to 35% at s/B=3.5. These findings are consistent with previous suggestions made for the optimal s/B ratio for encouraging soil arching between piles at maximum spacing both under monotonic conditions and from numerical investigations of the seismic problem. The improvements to slope performance were reduced slightly using the designed microreinforced concrete piles owing to deterioration in the bending properties arising from fatigue under the cyclic kinematic loading. This suggests that idealization of RC piles as elastic elements will likely be only an approximation of their true behavior. The importance of reinforcement detailing was also highlighted, with the nominally reinforced section yielding early in the earthquake, and the damaged piles subsequently only offering a small (although measureable) reduction in seismic slope performance compared with the unreinforced case. In addition to these findings, the data presented will be useful in validating future improved numerical models for predicting the performance of piled slopes and for the aseismic design of pile-reinforcing schemes.", "title": "Centrifuge Modeling of the Seismic Performance of Pile-Reinforced Slopes", "id": 57}, {"journal": "IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine", "authors": ["A.

The tissue storage solution TiProtec\u00ae and a chloride-poor modification, each with and without iron chelators, were used for cold incubation. Incubation was performed 4\u00b0C for up to 168 h, followed by rewarming in an extracellular buffer (3 h at 37\u00b0C). After 48, 120 and 168 h of cold incubation LDH release was lower in solutions containing iron chelators. After rewarming, injury increased especially after cold incubation in chelator-free solutions. Without addition of iron chelators LDH release showed a tendency to be higher in chloride-poor solutions. Following rewarming after 48 h of cold incubation lipid peroxidation was significantly decreased and metabolic activity was tendentially better in tubules incubated with iron chelators. Morphological alterations included mitochondrial swelling and fragmentation being partially reversible during rewarming. ATP content was better preserved in chloride-rich solutions. During rewarming, there was a further decline of ATP content in the so far best conditions and minor alterations under the other conditions, while oxygen consumption was not significantly different compared to non-stored control tubules.

We used logistic regression to test whether sexual behaviors are consistent with serosorting and to test whether risk group is associated with having concordant traceable partners among men reporting unprotected anal intercourse (UAI). Results: We included 513 MSM (54% lower risk and 75% HIV -negative). Lower risk and high-risk MSM with concordant traceable partners were more likely to have UAI than MSM with discordant partners or partners of unknown HIV status ( P < 0.001). Risk group was not associated with having concordant UAI. Compared with lower risk MSM, however, high-risk MSM frequently had UAI with nonconcordant traceable partners and with anonymous partners. Conclusions: Sexual risk behaviors with traceable partners are consistent with serosorting . Nonetheless, the higher level of UAI with anonymous or nonconcordant traceable partners more likely explains the increasing HIV incidence seen among STI Outpatient Clinic attendees than a difference in serosorting behavior.", "title": "Condom Use Rather Than Serosorting Explains Differences in HIV Incidence Among Men Who Have Sex With Men", "id": 76}, {"journal": "Fluid Phase Equilibria", "authors": ["A.

On the basis of these data, we wanted to determine the lifetime health benefits and health care costs associated with intensive control versus standard control.Methods We used a microsimulation model to apply SPRINT treatment effects and health care costs from national sources to a hypothetical cohort of SPRINT-eligible adults. The model projected lifetime costs of treatment and monitoring in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease events and subsequent treatment costs, treatment-related risks of serious adverse events and subsequent costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for intensive control versus standard control of systolic blood pressure.Results We determined that the mean number of QALYs would be 0.27 higher among patients who received intensive control than among those who received standard control and would cost approximately $47,000 more per QALY gained if there were a reduction in adherence and treatment effects after 5 years; the cost would be approximately $28,000 more per QALY gained if the treatment effects persisted for the remaining lifetime of the patient. Most simulation results indicated that intensive treatment would be cost-effective (51 to 79% below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY and 76 to 93% below the threshold of $100,000 per QALY), regardless of whether treatment effects were reduced after 5 years or persisted for the remaining lifetime.Conclusions In this simulation study, intensive systolic blood-pressure control prevented cardiovascular disease events and prolonged life and did so at levels below common willingness-to-pay thresholds per QALY, regardless of whether benefits were reduced after 5 years or persisted for the patient\u2019s remaining lifetime.

Simultaneous double kidney transplantation (SDKT) with kidneys obtained from elderly adults has been proposed to increase the transplantation number and improve its results. However, if SDKT is performed when there are no clear indications, a negative effect could be produced on the total number of transplanted patients as both kidneys would be used for only one recipient. Material and Methods.: In December 1996 we designed a transplantation protocol to be able to extend the selection of cadaver kidney donors with normal serum creatinine levels without establishing any age limit. A pregraft renal biopsy was always performed to analyze the glomerulosclerosis (GE) percentage whenever the donors were 60 years of age or older. A SDKT was performed in a single recipient when the donor age was 75 years or older or when the donors between 60 and 74 years old had a GE rate of more than 15%. On the contrary, a single kidney transplantation was performed in two different recipients for kidneys from donors between 60 and 74 years of age with a GE rate of less than 15%. Kidneys having GE rates of more than 50% were discarded for transplantation. Donor kidneys from subjects younger than 60 years of age were always used for a single kidney transplantation. Results.: Based on the above mentioned protocol, from December 1996 to May 1998, 181 patients received a kidney transplantation in our hospital. These patients were divided into three groups: group I which included the SDKT recipients (n=21), group II or single kidney recipients from 60- to 74-year-old donors (n=40), and group III or recipients from <60-year-old donors (n=120). The mean follow-up time was 15\u00b15 months (range 6\u201324). Mean donor age was 75\u00b17 years in group I, this was significantly higher than in group II (67\u00b14, P <0.001) and group III (37\u00b115, P <0.001). The primary nonfunction rate was low in the three groups, there being no statistically significant differences (5, 5, and 4%, respectively). A significantly greater percentage of patients from group I (76%) presented immediate renal graft function as compared with group II (43%, P <0.01) and III (50%, P <0.05). The acute rejections rate was very low in all three groups (9.5, 7.5, and 22%, respectively) with significant differences between groups II and III ( P <0.05). No significant differences between the different groups were observed for one year actuarial patient survival (100, 95, and 98%, respectively) or graft survival rates (95, 90, and 93%, respectively). The 6-month serum creatinine levels were excellent in the three groups, although there were significant differences between groups I and II (1.6\u00b10.3 vs. 1.9\u00b10.6 mg/dl, P <0.05), II and III (1.9\u00b10.6 vs. 1.4\u00b10.4 mg/dl, P <0.001), and I and III ( P <0.05). Conclusions.: Simultaneous double kidney transplantations make it possible to use kidneys from extremely elderly donors (>75 years) or those whose GE>15%.

Based on DSC measurements, it appears that these systems are liquid at room temperature for a lithium salt mole fraction ranging from 0.10 to 0.35. The temperature dependences of the ionic conductivity and the viscosity of these DESs are correctly described by using the Vogel\u2013Tammann\u2013Fulcher (VTF) type fitting equation, due to the strong interactions between Li+, X\u2212 and MAc in solution. Furthermore, these electrolytes possess quite large electrochemical stability windows up to 4.7\u20135 V on Pt, and demonstrate also a passivating behavior toward the aluminum collector at room temperature. Based on these interesting electrochemical properties, these selected DESs can be classified as potential and promising electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). For this purpose, a test cell was then constructed and tested at 25 \u00b0C, 60 \u00b0C and 80 \u00b0C by using each selected DES as an electrolyte and LiFePO4 (LFP) material as a cathode. The results show a good compatibility between each DES and LFP electrode material. A capacity of up to 160 mA h g\u22121 with a good efficiency (99%) is observed in the DES based on the LiNO3 salt at 60 \u00b0C despite the presence of residual water in the electrolyte.

DNA sequences encoding continuous linear epitopes, the antigenic site A from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) VP1 protein and the DAff3 antigenic determinant from transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) nucleoprotein N, were separately cloned into the p54 gene, in a region encoding a non-essential domain of the protein.

The resulting recombinant viruses efficiently expressed both chimeric proteins under transcriptional control of the p54 promoter, and the chimeric gene products were recognized by antibodies to both p54 and foreign epitopes. The modified p54 proteins were also found in the viral particles and complemented the function of the wild-type p54, since deletion of the p54 gene from recombinant viruses did not affected virus replication in Vero cells.

For example, a system might tell when a train driver is incapacitated by a medical event, and assist in adopting a safe recovery strategy. These applications are demanding, because they require accurate detection of rare anomalies that may be seen only at runtime. Such a setting causes supervised methods to perform poorly. We describe a method for detecting an anomalous face image that meets these requirements. We construct a feature vector that reliably has large entries for anomalous images, then use various simple unsupervised methods to score the image based on the feature. Obvious constructions (autoencoder codes; autoencoder residuals) are defeated by a 'peeking' behavior in autoencoders. Our feature construction removes rectangular patches from the image, predicts the likely content of the patch conditioned on the rest of the image using a specially trained autoencoder, then compares the result to the image. High scores suggest that the patch was difficult for an autoencoder to predict, and so is likely anomalous. We demonstrate that our method can identify real anomalous face images in pools of typical images, taken from celeb-A, that is much larger than usual in state-of-the-art experiments.

In this work we address both those issues by means of a novel computational technique, i.e. computational stigmergy. By using computational stigmergy each sample position is associated with a digital pheromone deposit, which aggregates with other deposits according to their spatiotemporal proximity. By processing transactions data with computational stigmergy, it is possible to identify high-density areas (hotspots) occurring in different time and days, as well as, analyze their consistency over time. Indeed, a hotspot can be permanent, i.e. present throughout the period of observation, or intermittent, i.e. present only in certain time and days due to community level occurrences (e.g. nightlife). Such difference is not only spatial (where the hotspot occurs) and temporal (when the hotspot occurs) but affects also which people visit the hotspot.

Most of them have uninsulated walls or suffer from insufficient thermal insulation materials. These buildings are inseparable parts of the cultural, social, and economic characteristics of their cities. Due to heritage and preservation concerns, zoning, and space restrictions, they cannot be retrofitted with exterior insulation. Interior insulation must therefore be considered as an alternative. Lack of insulation directly results in energy waste as well as heat loss and gain. Furthermore, it adversely affects heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads, equipment sizing, indoor air quality, and thermal comfort for residents. The objective of this study is to simulate and evaluate the effects of various internal thermal insulation materials and strategies on mass masonry load-bearing walls in multifamily buildings with attention to various variables and parameters. It not only addresses the energy performance and cost savings associated with an interior insulation retrofit, but also outlines other variables and parameters that are factors in the selection of optimum insulation material, including installations costs, payback periods, useful internal space loss, and options for the depth of the interior insulation retrofit.

(2008) reported results from the upper third, and this paper reports the lower two thirds of the 3500\u2010m\u2010thick composite section. The methods employed are the same, i.e., combined use of petrology, volcanology, chemostratigraphy, morphology, K\u2010Ar absolute dating, study of sedimentary alteration horizons, and as the main correlation tool, analysis of detailed paleomagnetic remanence directions. The thickness and volume of the flood basalt province studied in this way are therefore tripled. A total of 169 sites from eight new sections are reported in this paper. Together with the results of Chenet et al. (2008), these data represent in total 70% of the 3500\u2010m combined section of the main Deccan traps province. This lava pile was erupted in some 30 major eruptive periods or single eruptive events (SEE), each with volumes ranging from 1000 to 20,000 km3 and 41 individual lava units with a typical volume of 1300 km3. Paleomagnetic analysis shows that some SEEs with thicknesses attaining 200 m were emplaced over distances in excess of 100 km (both likely underestimates, due to outcrop conditions) and up to 800 km. The total time of emission of all combined SEEs could have been (much) less than 10 ka, with most of the time recorded in a very small number of intervening alteration levels marking periods of volcanic quiescence (so\u2010called \u201cbig red boles\u201d). The number of boles, thickness of the pulses, and morphology of the traps suggest that eruptive fluxes and volumes were larger in the older formations and slowed down with more and longer quiescence periods in the end. On the basis of geochronologic results published by Chenet et al. (2007) and paleontological results from Keller et al. (2008), we propose that volcanism occurred in three rather short, discrete phases or megapulses, an early one at \u223c67.5 \u00b1 1 Ma near the C30r/C30n transition and the two largest around 65 \u00b1 1 Ma, one entirely within C29r just before the K\u2010T boundary, the other shortly afterward spanning the C29r/C29n reversal. We next estimate sulfur dioxide (likely a major agent of environmental stress) amounts and fluxes released by SEEs: they would have ranged from 5 to 100 Gt and 0.1 to 1 Gt/a, respectively, over durations possibly as short as 100 years for each SEE. The chemical input of the Chicxulub impact would have been on the same order as that of a very large single pulse.

Lack of paleosecular variation allows identification of four directional groups, implying very large (40 to 180 m thick) single eruptive events (SEEs) having occurred in a few decades. Paleomagnetism allows temporal constraints upon the formation of 9 out of 23 thin red bole levels found in the sections to no more than a few decades; the two thickest altered layers could have formed in 1 to 50 ka.

Flood basalt emission can be translated into SO2 injection rates of several Gt a\u22121, which could have been the main agent of environmental change. The total volume of SO2 emitted by the larger SEEs could be on the order of that released by the Chicxulub impact. Moreover, each SEE may have injected 10 to 100 times more SO2 in the atmosphere than the deleterious 1783 Laki eruption.

Methods: We develop a general computational approach along with an efficient estimation procedure in the widely used generalized linear model (GLM) framework to characterize such nonstationary dynamics in spiking response and spatiotemporal characteristics of a neuron at the level of individual trials. The model employs a set of modulatory components, which nonlinearly interact with other stimulus-related signals to reproduce such nonstationary effects. Results: The model is tested for its ability to predict the responses of neurons in the middle temporal cortex of macaque monkeys during an eye movement task. The fitted model proves successful in capturing the fast temporal modulations in the response, reproducing the spike response temporal statistics, and accurately accounting for the neurons' dynamic spatiotemporal sensitivities, during eye movements. Conclusion: The nonstationary GLM framework developed in this study can be used in cases where a time-varying behavioral or cognitive component makes GLM-based models insufficient to describe the dependencies of neural responses on the stimulus-related covariates. Significance: In addition to being quite powerful in encoding time-varying response modulations, this general framework also enables a readout of the neural code while dissociating the influence of other nonstimulus covariates.

Usually only the upper layers of the concrete structure are contaminated and are removed using labor-intensive mechanical milling processes. Production of a large amount of dust, which can lead to secondary contamination, is inherent to these processes. Improvements in high-energy laser technology have now made it possible for laser radiation to be used in decontamination technologies for the removal of concrete layers. A decontamination unit comprising a diode laser with a beam power of 10 kW in continuous wave (CW) mode in combination with an autonomous manipulator was developed for use in nuclear plants. The laser beam melts the concrete surface to a depth of approximately 5 mm. Compressed air jets then detach the molten layer from the concrete surface and convey it to a suction system, with which it is transported to a collection container. Most of the radionuclides are trapped in the solidifying melt particles, which form an extremely stable effluent well suited to long-term storage. A relatively small amount of dust is generated in the process. Because there is no backlash during energy transfer, the laser device carrier can be designed to be lightweight and flexible. A specially developed manipulator that can move freely along walls and ceilings by means of suction plates is used for the carrier unit.

Today\u2019s commercially available diode lasers with powers higher than 50 kW enable ablation rates of &gt;10 m\u00b2/h to be achieved and hence make these laser-based systems competitive alternatives to mechanical systems.Decontamination of radioactive concrete surfaces may be necessary during operation or decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Usually only the upper layers of the concrete structure are contaminated and are removed using labor-intensive mechanical milling processes. Production of a large amount of dust, which can lead to secondary contamination, is inherent to these processes. Improvements in high-energy laser technology have now made it possible for laser radiation to be used in decontamination technologies for the removal of concrete layers. A decontamination unit comprising a diode laser with a beam power of 10 kW in continuous wave (CW) mode in combination with an autonomous manipulator was developed for use in nuclear plants. The laser beam melts the concrete surface to a depth of approximately 5 mm. Compressed air jets then detach the molten layer from the concrete surface and convey it to a suction system, with which it is transported to a collection container. Most of the radionuclides are trapped in the solidifying melt particles, which form an extremely stable effluent well suited to long-term storage. A relatively small amount of dust is generated in the process. Because there is no backlash during energy transfer, the laser device carrier can be designed to be lightweight and flexible. A specially developed manipulator that can move freely along walls and ceilings by means of suction plates is used for the carrier unit. This results in short setup times for preparing for use of the device and minimal personnel exposure to the radiation.

To achieve this end, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics is employed. Geometrical configuration of spiral-wound heat exchangers can be completely determined by knowing six primary parameters including start factor, tube outside diameter, number of tubes in the first layer, number of layers, longitudinal pitch, and radial pitch. Dividing the longitudinal and radial pitches by tube outside diameter, the six primary geometrical parameters reduce to five non-dimensional parameters. The effects of number of tubes in the first layer, number of layers, longitudinal pitch to tube outside diameter ratio, and radial pitch to tube outside diameter ratio referred to as four main non-dimensional parameters on flow and heat transfer are numerically studied by modeling 64 different geometries. The results indicate that the number of tubes in the first layer is the only parameter among four main non-dimensional parameters that does not have any influence on the flow characteristics. Based on the numerical simulation results, multivariate correlations for average Nusselt number and friction factor have been developed taking into account the three remaining main non-dimensional parameters, i.e. the number of layers, the longitudinal pitch to tube outside diameter ratio, and the radial pitch to tube outside diameter ratio.

A persistent challenge to understanding such complex systems concerns efficient development of quantitative kinetic models. In this work, we demonstrate development of a comprehensive, empirical microkinetic model of AHF. Central to these studies is exploitation of the information-rich, operando Wisconsin High-Pressure NMR Reactor to collect data for a variety of noncatalytic transformations that focus on different regions of the overall catalytic cycle. Kinetic analysis of these transformations leads to kinetic models for segments of the full cycle; we call these \u201cmini-models.\u201d According to a divide-and-conquer strategy, these individual \u201cmini-models\u201d are combined to build up the full microkinetic catalytic model. This comprehensive model fits all noncatalytic and catalytic data simultaneously, and enables detailed examination of the steps controlling reaction rate, regioselectivity, and enantioselectivity. Scaled sensitivity analysis indicates that, even under catalytic conditions with different resting states, just a few steps impart the largest degree of rate control. In comparison with a simple pedagogical model, we quantitatively demonstrate that we cannot assume the catalyst resting state immediately precedes the turnover-limiting step in mechanisms that include off-cycle catalyst species. These models conclusively demonstrate that even when most of the catalyst lies off-cycle, if the catalyst speciation is at steady-state then the rates of off-cycle steps are irrelevant to rate control. Under steady-state conditions, the presence of off-cycle species serves only to lower the catalytic efficiency by lowering the on-cycle catalyst concentrations.", "title": "Development of a Comprehensive Microkinetic Model for Rh(bis(diazaphospholane))-Catalyzed Hydroformylation", "id": 119}, {"journal": "Analytical Chemistry", "authors": ["A.

Per current guidelines, these patients have usually undergone several cycles of potentially hepatotoxic systemic chemotherapy before Y90 -RE is at all considered, requiring split (lobar) treatment sessions to reduce hepatic toxicity. Assessing response to Y90 -RE early, that is, already after the first lobar session, would be helpful to avoid an ineffective and potentially hepatotoxic second lobar treatment. We investigated the accuracy with which diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( DWI -MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) can provide this information. Methods: An institutional review board\u2013approved prospective intraindividual comparison trial on 35 patients who underwent fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT and DWI -MRI within 6 weeks before and 6 weeks after Y90 -RE to treat secondary-progressive liver metastases from solid cancers (20 colorectal, 13 breast, 2 other) was performed. An increase of minimal apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmin) or decrease of maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) by at least 30% was regarded as positive response. Long-term clinical and imaging follow-up was used to distinguish true- from false-response classifications. Results: On the basis of long-term follow-up, 23 (66%) of 35 patients responded to the Y90 treatment. No significant changes of metastases size or contrast enhancement were observable on pretreatment versus posttreatment CT or magnetic resonance images.However, overall SUVmax decreased from 8.0 \u00b1 3.9 to 5.5 \u00b1 2.2 ( P < 0.0001), and ADCmin increased from 0.53 \u00b1 0.13 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mm 2 /s to 0.77 \u00b1 0.26 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mm 2 /s ( P < 0.0001). Pretherapeutic versus posttherapeutic changes of ADCmin and SUVmax correlated moderately ( r = \u22120.53). In 4 of the 35 patients (11%), metastases were fluorodeoxyglucose-negative such that no response assessment was possible by PET. In 25 (71%) of the 35 patients, response classification by PET and DWI -MRI was concordant; in 6 (17%) of the 35, it was discordant. In 5 of the 6 patients with discordant classifications, follow-up confirmed diagnoses made by DWI . The positive predictive value to predict response was 22 (96%) of 23 for MRI and 15 (88%) of 17 for PET. The negative predictive value to predict absence was 11 (92%) of 12 for MRI and 10 (56%) of 18 for PET. Sensitivity for detecting response was significantly higher for MRI (96%; 22/23) than for PET (65%; 15/23) ( P < 0.02). Conclusions: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging appears superior to PET/CT for early response assessment in patients with hepatic metastases of common solid tumors.

Vaccine failure/effectiveness was compared between girls and boys for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), invasive Hib disease and pertussis using notification data.For pneumococcal vaccination, the geometric mean concentration ratio of IgG levels in girls versus boys pooled across serotypes was 1.15 (95%CI 0.91\u20131.45) 1\u202fmonth following the primary series, 1.16 (1.02\u20131.32) at age 8\u202fmonths, 1.12 (1.02\u20131.23) pre-booster (age 11\u202fmonths) and 0.99 (0.89\u20131.10) post-booster (age 12\u202fmonths).

To understand the visual limits of flight control in bees, which rely heavily on vision to control flight, and to explore whether they vary between species, we tested how changes in spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity affect the speed and position control of the Asian and European honeybees (Apis cerana and Apis mellifera).

While the effect of spatial frequency and contrast on position control is similar between the species, ground speed is differently affected by these variables. A comparison with published data from the bumblebee Bombus terrestris revealed further differences. The visual resolution that limits the detection and use of optic flow for flight control in both species of honeybee is lower than the previously anatomically determined resolution and differs from object detection limits of A. mellifera, providing evidence that the limits of spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity are highly tuned to the particular behavioural task of a species.", "title": "Differences in spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity of flight control in the honeybees Apis cerana and Apis melliferaDifferences in spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity of flight control in the honeybees Apis cerana and Apis melliferaDifferences in spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity of flight control in the honeybees Apis cerana and Apis mellifera", "id": 145}, {"journal": "Obesity", "authors": ["A.

Upon replication of the (\u2212)DNA to (+)DNA, the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase incorporates adenines opposite the uracils, thereby inducing C/G\u2192T/A mutations that can functionally inactivate HIV-1. Although both APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G are expressed in cell types HIV-1 infects and are suppressed by Vif, there has been no prior biochemical analysis of APOBEC3F, in contrast to APOBEC3G. Using synthetic DNA substrates, we characterized APOBEC3F and found that similar to APOBEC3G; it is a processive enzyme and can deaminate at least two cytosines in a single enzyme-substrate encounter. However, APOBEC3F scanning movement is distinct from APOBEC3G, and relies on jumping rather than both jumping and sliding. APOBEC3F jumping movements were also different from APOBEC3G. The lack of sliding movement from APOBEC3F is due to an 190NPM192 motif, since insertion of this motif into APOBEC3G decreases its sliding movements. The APOBEC3G NPM mutant induced significantly less mutations in comparison to wild-type APOBEC3G in an in vitro model HIV-1 replication assay and single-cycle infectivity assay, indicating that differences in DNA scanning were relevant to restriction of HIV-1. Conversely, mutation of the APOBEC3F 191Pro to 191Gly enables APOBEC3F sliding movements to occur. Although APOBEC3F 190NGM192 could slide, the enzyme did not induce more mutagenesis than wild-type APOBEC3F, demonstrating that the unique jumping mechanism of APOBEC3F abrogates the influence of sliding on mutagenesis. Overall, we demonstrate key differences in the impact of APOBEC3F- and APOBEC3G-induced mutagenesis on HIV-1 that supports a model in which both the processive DNA scanning mechanism and preferred deamination motif (APOBEC3F, 5\u2032TTC; APOBEC3G 5\u2032CCC) influences the mutagenic and gene inactivation potential of an APOBEC3 enzyme.", "title": "Different Mutagenic Potential of HIV-1 Restriction Factors APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F Is Determined by Distinct Single-Stranded DNA Scanning Mechanisms", "id": 147}, {"journal": "Psychopharmacology", "authors": ["A.

Although atomoxetine has established efficacy, the mechanisms which mediate its effects are not well understood. Objectives In this study, we investigated the role of cortical versus sub-cortical noradrenaline by using focal dopamine beta hydroxylase-saporin-induced lesions, to the prefrontal cortex ( n = 16) or nucleus accumbens shell ( n = 18). Methods Healthy animals were tested by using the forced-choice serial reaction time task to assess the impact of the lesion on baseline performance and the response to atomoxetine and the psychostimulant amphetamine. Results We observed attenuation in the efficacy of atomoxetine in animals with lesions to the nucleus accumbens shell, but not the prefrontal cortex. Amphetamine-induced increases in premature responses were potentiated in animals with lesions to the prefrontal cortex, but not the nucleus accumbens shell. Conclusions These data suggest that noradrenaline in the nucleus accumbens shell plays an important role in the effects of atomoxetine. Under these conditions, prefrontal cortex noradrenaline did not appear to contribute to atomoxetine\u2019s effects suggesting a lack of cortical-mediated \u201ctop-down\u201d modulation. Noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex appears to contribute to the modulation of impulsive responding in amphetamine-treated animals, with a loss of noradrenaline associated with potentiation of its effects.

Objective: The insertion of a sutureless aortic anastomosis (SAA) during coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) for construction of proximal vein graft anastomoses may reduce manipulations of the aorta. Thus, SAA could possibly improve the neuropsychologic outcome of patients after CABG surgery. Material and methods: 45 patients were included in a prospective, randomised study comparing a commercially available SAA (\u201cSymmetry Bypass System Aortic Connector, St. Jude Medical, Inc., Minneapolis, USA) to conventional CABG surgery. A neuropsychological test battery was applied before and 5\u20138 days after surgery, cerebral microemboli were recorded using a transcranial Doppler (TCD) measuring high intensity transient signals (HITS) intraoperatively. Results: Duration of surgery, ECC (extracorporeal circulation) time and the number of distal and proximal anastomoses were not significantly different. The mean number of HITS during ECC (conv. CABG 277\u00b1335, SAA 249\u00b1508 HITS) did not differ significantly between the two groups. Interestingly, during insertion of the SAA device, a mean number of 16\u00b115 HITS was documented, while the mean number of HITS during partial and complete clamping and declamping of the aorta was 25\u00b139 in the conventional group. In the SAA group, 6/23 patients had to be excluded from the study due to SAA device-related problems. In both groups, no clinical apparent stroke or delirium occurred after surgery. Different statistical analyses of the neuropsychological tests (% group mean changes, 20% difference, linear regression) showed a slightly impaired neuropsychological outcome in the Connector group compared to the CABG group.

However, no information is available regarding the effect of femoral head size on the survivorship of HXLPE hip prostheses. The aim of the present study was to provide evidence regarding whether femoral head size has an effect on the risk of revision when an HXLPE liner is used on a metal head. Methods: A distributed health data network was developed by the ICOR (International Consortium of Orthopaedic Registries). Six national and regional registries are participating in this network: Kaiser Permanente, HealthEast, the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy, the Catalan region in Spain, Norway, and Australia. Data from each registry were standardized and provided at an aggregate level for each of the variables of interest. Patients with osteoarthritis who were forty-five to sixty-four years of age and had undergone uncemented total hip arthroplasty were included in the present study. Analyses were performed on the basis of individual patient profiles, utilizing the variables collected from each registry. The outcome of interest was the time to the first revision (for any reason). Survival probabilities and their standard errors were extracted from each registry for each unique combination of the covariates and were combined through multivariate meta-analysis utilizing linear mixed models to compare survivorship for <32-mm, 32-mm, and >32-mm femoral head sizes. Results: A total of 14,372 total hip arthroplasties were included in the study. The five-year rate of revision surgery varied from 1.9% to 3.2% among registries. The risk of revision did not differ significantly between <32-mm and 32-mm head sizes (HR [hazard ratio] = 0.91, 95% CI [confidence interval] = 0.69 to 1.19) or between >32-mm and 32-mm sizes (HR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.70 to 1.55).

However, themechanisms by which this hormone elicits many of its normal as well aspathological effects are unclear. To identify both known and unknowngenes that are regulated by or associated with estrogen action, weperformed serial analysis of gene expression on estrogen-responsivebreast cancer cells after exposure to this hormone. We examinedapproximately 190,000 mRNA transcripts and monitored the expressionbehavior of 12,550 genes. Expression levels for the vast majority ofthose transcripts were observed to remain constant upon 17\u03b2 estradiol(E2) treatment. Only approximately 0.4% of the genesshowed an increase in expression of \u22653-fold by 3 hpost-E2 treatment. We cloned five novel genes(E2IG1-5), which were observedup-regulated by the hormonal treatment. Of these the most highlyinduced transcript, E2IG1, appears to be a novel memberof the family of small heat shock proteins. The E2IG4gene is a new member of the large family of leucine-richrepeat-containing proteins. On the basis of architectural and domainhomology, this gene appears to be a good candidate for secretion in theextracellular environment and, therefore, may play a role in breasttissue remodeling and/or epithelium-stroma interactions. Severalinteresting genes with a potential role in the regulation of cell cycleprogression were also identified to increase in expression, includingPescadillo and chaperonin CCT2. Twoputative paracrine/autocrine factors of potential importance in theregulation of the growth of breast cancer cells were identified to behighly up-regulated by E2: stanniocalcin 2, acalcium/phosphate homeostatic hormone; and inhibin-\u03b2 B, aTGF-\u03b2-like factor. Interestingly, we also determined thatE2IG1 and stanniocalcin 2 wereexclusively overexpressed in estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancerlines, and thus they have the potential to serve as breast cancerbiomarkers.

Very few organic semiconductors are suitable for maintaining optimal efficiencies in cells with thicker junctions. This paradigm is beginning to shift with the recent high mobility donor polymers, where electrically inverted thick heterojunction structures deliver impressive efficiencies. The inverted architecture seems to be an essential feature of these solar cells. The reason for this has yet to be explained, and in this work, we address this question. We present analytical simulations and experimental evidence showing how the charge generation and extraction physics is significantly different in thin and thick heterojunctions, inverted and conventional. In particular, our predictive model shows how the inverted architecture compensates for strongly imbalanced carrier mobilities, which would otherwise cause debilitating recombination. Thick bulk heterojunctions can be designed to deliver high efficiencies, but for high mobility donors, this is only in an inverted architecture.

Transduced, GFP+ cells were cultured in serum-free medium containing cytokines that primarily support the growth of primitive hematopoietic progenitors.

However, enforced expression of HOXB4 by the adenoviral vector significantly increased myeloid differentiation of primitive hematopoietic progenitors. Since retroviral vectors generate low and continuous levels of transgene expression in contrast to the high, transient levels generated by the adenoviral vector, our findings suggest that the high levels of HOXB4 expression generated by AdHOXB4 in human CB CD34+ cells direct the cells toward a myeloid differentiation program rather than increased proliferation.", "title": "Enforced adenoviral vector-mediated expression of HOXB4 in human umbilical cord blood cd34+ cells promotes myeloid differentiation but not proliferation", "id": 187}, {"journal": "Biomedical Microdevices", "authors": ["A.

In this paper the swarm coordination of UAVs employed in target search is based on flocking and stigmergy, to provide robust formation control and dynamic environmental information sharing, respectively. The design of both metaheuristics takes into account UAVs equipment, and the coordination logic is adapted to the mission by means of a differential evolutionary algorithm. This algorithm optimizes the aggregated structural parameters of all metaheuristics to allow the most efficient coordination with respect to the mission environment.

The results confirmed a seed region-driven targeting potential by the miRNA, with mimics downregulating and inhibitors enhancing luciferase activity. Introducing mutations into the miRNA target seed region abolished the expected response. In cultured podocytes, FOXC2 mRNA and protein levels responded to miR-548c-5p abundance in a coordinated manner before and after induction of differentiation, with high statistical significance.

Also densities of bacteriophagous and phytophagous nematodes, Acari and Collembola increased after sod inoculation. The cover of heathland plant species increased by 49% after sod inoculation. The introduction of solely aboveground heathland species increased the cover of these species by only 13%, and did not affect soil community assembly. Additionally, the increase in cover of heathland species over time was inversely correlated to the cover of mesotrophic grassland species. Inverse correlations were also observed between changes in fungal and bacterial abundances. Simultaneous introduction of key species of both above- and below-ground communities had a critical effect on the establishment of both communities, providing a potential shortcut for successful restoration of target ecosystems on disturbed soils.Rate of change per year in the above and between above- and belowground communities after addition of herbage or soil from well-developed heathlands.Download high-res image (150KB)Download full-size image", "title": "Facilitating ecosystem assembly: Plant-soil interactions as a restoration tool", "id": 213}, {"journal": "Ocean Engineering", "authors": ["A.

With the rise of smart phones and tablets having large screens, users have become more interested than anytime before in watching linear and non-linear TV programs on their mobile devices. This is because the users can fetch nowadays the content using their mobile devices at anytime and any place they are located. Facing this phenomenon, broadcasters are looking for new means to reach the users of digital natives that are interested in watching TV on their mobile devices. As most mobile devices are based on a global 3rd generation partnership project standard, the enhanced multimedia broadcast multicast system (eMBMS) of long term evolution (LTE) network is foreseen as one potential candidate for delivering broadcast services. In order to investigate the capability and limitations of today's LTE eMBMS network, a field trial was carried out in Munich, Germany. This paper describes the setup of the field trial and presents a comprehensive analysis of the LTE eMBMS technology with respect to performance and future enhancements. The measurement data is compared against simulation models for field strength and path loss of each transmitter, eMBMS useful field strength and received power, and signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR). Moreover, the performance of cyclic prefix (CP) durations that are longer than the standardized values of 16.67 us and 33.33 us is evaluated using the calibrated simulation models. Results have shown that the simulation models can adequately predict the measurement data. Moreover, it is shown that a CP duration of 66.67 us provides a gain in SINR and achieves the best tradeoff in terms of maximum user velocity and performance in networks with limited inter-site distance.", "title": "Field Trial of LTE eMBMS Network for TV Distribution: Experimental Results and Analysis", "id": 219}, {"journal": "Progress in Organic Coatings", "authors": ["A.

NMD is also involved in the control of several wild-type mRNAs. The NMD core machinery consists of three highly conserved NMD factors (UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3) and at least one less conserved 14-3-3-like domain containing protein (SMG7). A PTC is identified by UPF factors, and then SMG7 triggers rapid transcript decay. UPF factors are generally encoded by a single gene, whereas SMG7 has duplicated several times during evolution. Recently it was reported that the plant SMG7 is autoregulated through NMD and that SMG7 has two relatively divergent paralogs in dicots, SMG7 and SMG7L. In mammals all three SMG7 related genes (SMG5, SMG6 and SMG7) are essential in NMD, so we hypothesized that in plants the SMG7 and SMG7L duplicates may also play distinct roles in NMD. To test this possibility, we have analyzed the evolution and the function of plant SMG7 homologs. We show that SMG7L is not required for plant NMD. Interestingly, we found that the grapevine and poplar genomes contain two quite divergent SMG7 paralogs which may have derived from an ancient duplication event. Using heterolog depletion/complementation assays we demonstrate that both grapevine SMG7 copies retained the complete NMD activity and both of them are under NMD control, whilst SMG7L has lost NMD activity and NMD control.", "title": "Functional analysis of the grapevine paralogs of the SMG7 NMD factor using a heterolog VIGS-based gene depletion-complementation system", "id": 225}, {"journal": "Journal of Public Economics", "authors": ["A.

We find that gender quotas are associated with an increase in the quality of elected politicians, with the effect ranging from 0.12 to 0.24 years of education. This effect is due not only to the higher number of elected women, who are on average more educated than men, but also to the lower number of low-educated elected men.

Methods: Data from a previous randomized trial of 315 smokers to naltrexone versus placebo were reanalyzed using West African (WA) genetic ancestry to define subpopulations. Logistic regression models were used to estimate treatment effects on early and end of treatment quit rates, by race and WA ancestry . Results: Among European Americans ( n =136), naltrexone significantly increased quit rates at 4 weeks (62 vs. 43%, P =0.03) with directional, but not statistically significant effects at 12 weeks (30 vs. 18%, P =0.12). In contrast, among the AAs ( n =95), quit rates did not differ between naltrexone and placebo groups at either interval (4 weeks: 43 vs. 32%, P =0.27; 12 weeks: 22 vs. 18%, P =0.60). A median split was conducted in AAs for WA ancestry . Among AAs with low WA ancestry , quit rates were significantly higher with naltrexone compared with placebo (60 vs. 27%, P =0.03).

The model was used to identify the association between several firearm regulations and male suicide rates.Our empirical analysis suggest that firearms regulations which function to reduce overall gun availability have a significant deterrent effect on male suicide, while regulations that seek to prohibit high risk individuals from owning firearms have a lesser effect.Restricting access to lethal means has been identified as an effective approach to suicide prevention, and firearms regulations are one way to reduce gun availability. The analysis suggests that gun control measures such as permit and licensing requirements have a negative effect on suicide rates among males. Since there is considerable heterogeneity among states with regard to gun control, these results suggest that there are opportunities for many states to reduce suicide by expanding their firearms regulations.", "title": "Gun control and suicide: The impact of state firearm regulations in the United States, 1995\u20132004", "id": 236}, {"journal": "Energy Policy", "authors": ["A.

Therefore, we studied three species each of bats (Artibeus lituratus, Sturnira lilium and Carollia perspicillata) and nonflying mammals (Akodon montensis, Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus). Using standard pharmacokinetic techniques in intact animals, we confirmed the greater paracellular nutrient absorption in the fliers, comparing one species in each group. Then we conducted in situ intestinal perfusions on individuals of all species. In both approaches, we measured the absorption of 3OMD-glucose, a nonmetabolizable glucose analog absorbed both paracellularly and transcellularly, as well as l-arabinose, which has no mediated transport. Fractional absorption of l-arabinose was three times higher in the bat (S. lilium: 1.2\u00b10.24) than in the rodent (A. montensis: 0.35\u00b10.04), whereas fractional absorption of 3OMD-glucose was complete in both species (1.46\u00b10.4 and 0.97\u00b10.12, respectively). In agreement, bats exhibited two to 12 times higher l-arabinose clearance per square centimeter nominal surface area than rodents in intestinal perfusions.

Outcomes included incidence of accepted claims per 100\u2009000 workers, the median and 75th percentile insurer decision time in days, and the median and 75th percentile of work disability duration in weeks. Effects were assessed relative to a comparator of seven other Australian workers\u2019 compensation jurisdictions.Results n=1\u2009069\u2009231 accepted workers\u2019 compensation claims were analysed. Claiming in NSW fell 15.3% following legislative reform, equivalent to 46.6 fewer claims per 100\u2009000 covered workers per month. This effect was greater in time loss claims (17.3%) than medical-only claims (10.3%). Across models, there were consistent trend increases in insurer decision time. Median work disability duration increased following the legislative reform.Conclusions The observed reduction in access to benefits was consistent with the policy objective of improving the financial sustainability of the compensation scheme.

The fluorescence rendered by an inorganic scintillator when irradiated with such gamma rays is gathered by a modified polymer optical fiber tip. This modification increases the recorded signal when compared with plain unaltered fiber. Two fiber tip modification are then compared in terms of light gathering capability. A chemically etched fiber, in which the cladding and part of the core are removed, and a tapered fiber in which the core-cladding structure is kept. Both structures are comparable in length and final diameter, and show linear response in the tested range up to 2 Gy/h air Kerma rate. The etched fiber shows a higher slope than the tapered one, although both improve the signal gathered by a plain fiber tip. The easy fabrication and handling of the reported transducers, together with the improved signal gathering, allow to reduce the overall system budget with the use of low-cost optoelectronics in the detection stage.

Interestingly, HIV increased mainly among older (\u2a7e35 years) MSM, whereas infection rates of rectal gonorrhoea increased mainly in younger men. To explore this discrepancy we compared trends in STIs and HIV in a cohort of young HIV negative homosexual men from 1984 until 2002.Methods: The study population included 863 men enrolled at \u2a7d30 years of age from 1984 onward in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS). They had attended at least one of the 6 monthly follow up ACS visits at which they completed a questionnaire (including self reported gonorrhoea and syphilis episodes) and were tested for syphilis and HIV. Yearly trends in HIV and STI incidence and risk factors were analysed using Poisson regression.Results: Mean age at enrolment was 25 years. The median follow up time was 4 years. Until 1995 trends in HIV and STI incidence were concurrent, however since 1995 there was a significant (p<0.05) increase in syphilis (0 to 1.4/100 person years (PY)) and gonorrhoea incidence (1.1 to 6.0/100 PY), but no change in HIV incidence (1.1 and 1.3/100 PY).Conclusions: The incidence of syphilis and gonorrhoea has increased among young homosexual men since 1995, while HIV incidence has remained stable. Increasing STI incidence underscores the potential for HIV spread among young homosexual men.

Charpentier"], "abstract": "en As economic and social contexts become more embedded within biodiversity conservation, it becomes obvious that resources are a limiting factor in conservation. This recognition is leading conservation scientists and practitioners to increasingly frame conservation decisions as trade\u2010offs between conflicting societal objectives. However, this framing is all too often done in an intuitive way, rather than by addressing trade\u2010offs explicitly. In contrast, the concept of trade\u2010off is a keystone in evolutionary biology, where it has been investigated extensively. I argue that insights from evolutionary theory can provide methodological and theoretical support to evaluating and quantifying trade\u2010offs in biodiversity conservation. I reviewed the diverse ways in which trade\u2010offs have emerged within the context of conservation and how advances from evolutionary theory can help avoid the main pitfalls of an implicit approach. When studying both evolutionary trade\u2010offs (e.g., reproduction vs. survival) and conservation trade\u2010offs (e.g., biodiversity conservation vs. agriculture), it is crucial to correctly identify the limiting resource, hold constant the amount of this resource when comparing different scenarios, and choose appropriate metrics to quantify the extent to which the objectives have been achieved. Insights from studies in evolutionary theory also reveal how an inadequate selection of conservation solutions may result from considering suboptimal rather than optional solutions when examining whether a trade\u2010off exits between 2 objectives. Furthermore, the shape of a trade\u2010off curve (i.e., whether the relationship between 2 objectives follows a concave, convex, or linear form) is known to affect crucially the definition of optimal solutions in evolutionary biology and very likely affects decisions in biodiversity conservation planning too. This interface between evolutionary biology and biodiversity conservation can therefore provide methodological guidance to support decision makers in the difficult task of choosing among conservation solutions. Percepciones de la Teor\u00eda de Historia de Vida para una Tratamiento Expl\u00edcito de las Compensaciones en la Biolog\u00eda de la Conservaci\u00f3n Abstractes Resumen A la vez que los contextos econ\u00f3micos y sociales se involucran m\u00e1s en la conservaci\u00f3n de la biodiversidad, se vuelve obvio que los recursos son un factor limitante en la conservaci\u00f3n. Este reconocimiento est\u00e1 llevando a los cient\u00edficos de la conservaci\u00f3n y a quienes la practican a enmarcar frecuentemente a las decisiones de conservaci\u00f3n como compensaciones entre objetivos sociales en conflicto. Sin embargo, esto suele hacerse de manera intuitiva, en lugar de dirigirse expl\u00edcitamente a las compensaciones. En contraste, el concepto de compensaci\u00f3n es una piedra angular en la biolog\u00eda evolutiva, en donde se ha investigado extensivamente. En este art\u00edculo discuto que las percepciones de la teor\u00eda evolutiva pueden proporcionar apoyo teor\u00e9tico y metodol\u00f3gico a la evaluaci\u00f3n y cuantificaci\u00f3n de las compensaciones en la conservaci\u00f3n de la biodiversidad. Revis\u00e9 las diversas formas en las que las compensaciones han emergido dentro del contexto de la conservaci\u00f3n y c\u00f3mo los avances de la teor\u00eda evolutiva pueden ayudar a evitar las principales dificultades de un enfoque impl\u00edcito. Al estudiar las compensaciones evolutivas (p. ej.: reproducci\u00f3n vs. supervivencia) y las compensaciones de conservaci\u00f3n (p. ej.: conservaci\u00f3n de la biodiversidad vs. agricultura), es importante identificar correctamente al recurso limitante, mantener como constante el aumento de este recurso al compararlo con escenarios diferentes y elegir las medidas apropiadas para cuantificar el alcance al que se han logrado los objetivos.

The two approaches have considerably different implications for how human wellbeing might be improved. Research in psychology, prevention science, and neuroscience is converging on an evolutionary account of the importance of two contrasting suites of social behavior\u2014prosociality vs. antisocial behaviors (crime, drug abuse, risky sexual behavior) and related problems such as depression. Prosociality of individuals and groups evolves in environments that minimize toxic biological and social conditions, promote and richly reinforce prosocial behavior and attitudes, limit opportunities for antisocial behavior, and nurture the pursuit of prosocial values. Conversely, antisocial behavior and related problems emerge in environments that are high in threat and conflict. Over the past 30 years, randomized trials have shown numerous family, school, and community interventions to prevent most problem behaviors and promote prosociality. Research has also shown that poverty and economic inequality are major risk factors for the development of problem behaviors. The paper describes policies that can reduce poverty and benefit youth development. Although it is clear that the canonical economic model of rational self-interest has made a significant contribution to the science of economics, the evidence reviewed here shows that it must be reconciled with an evolutionary perspective on human development and wellbeing if society is going to evolve public policies that advance the health and wellbeing of the entire population.", "title": "Integrating the human sciences to evolve effective policies", "id": 274}, {"journal": "Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects", "authors": ["A.

Monte Carlo simulations have revealed that the rate constant of the formation of electron\u2013hole bound states depends on the random encounter of opposite charges and is nearly given by the Langevin equation for the domain sizes relevant to efficient bulk heterojunction systems. Recently, three studies suggested that charge transfer states dissociating much faster than their decay rate to the ground state, can result in reduced bimolecular recombination by lowering the recombination rate to the ground state as a loss pathway. A separate study identified another loss pathway and suggested that forbidden back electron transfer from triplet charge transfer states to triplet excitons is a key to achieving reduced recombination. Herein we further explain the reduced bimolecular recombination by investigating the limitations of these two proposals. By solving kinetic rate equations for a BHJ system with realistic rates, we show that both of these previously presented conditions must only be held at the same time for a system to exhibit non-Langevin behavior. We demonstrate that suppression of both of the parallel loss channels of singlet and triplet states can be achieved through increasing the dissociation rate of the charge transfer states; a crucial requirement to achieve a high charge carrier extraction efficiency.", "title": "Interplay Between Triplet-, Singlet-Charge Transfer States and Free Charge Carriers Defining Bimolecular Recombination Rate Constant of Organic Solar Cells", "id": 280}, {"journal": "Journal of Physical Chemistry B", "authors": ["A.

In this study, we further investigated glutamatergic mechanisms using a novel version of the 5CSRTT, which we have previously shown to be more sensitive to cognitive enhancers. We first investigated the effects of systemic treatment with NMDA antagonists. We also carried out a preliminary investigation using targeted medial prefrontal cortex infusions of a NMDA antagonist (MK801), mGluR2/3 antagonist (LY341495), and mGluR7 negative allosteric modulator (MMPIP). Acute systemic administration of the different NMDA antagonists had no specific effects on accuracy. At higher doses PCP, ketamine, and memantine, increased omissions and affected other measures suggesting a general disruption in task performance. Only MK801 increased premature responses, and reduced omissions at lower doses suggesting stimulant like effects. None of the NMDA antagonists affected accuracy or any other measures when tested using a short stimulus challenge. Infusions of MK801 had no effect on accuracy but increased premature responses following infralimbic, but not prelimbic infusion. LY341495 had no effects in either brain region but a decrease in accuracy was observed following prelimbic infusion of MMPIP. Contrary to our hypothesis, disruptions to glutamate transmission using NMDA antagonists did not induce any clear deficits in accuracy in this modified version of the 5CSRTT. We also found that the profile of effects for MK801 differed from those observed with PCP, ketamine, and memantine.

In contrast to cholesterol, which is known to induce significant condensation of the membrane lipids, the cholesteryl-TEG anchor does not display this property. When the cholesteryl-TEG moiety was covalently bound to an oligonucleotide, the resulting lipophilic DNA molecules inserted spontaneously into lipid membranes without altering their structure. The duplex formed by two complementary cholesteryl-TEG oligonucleotides had increased thermodynamic stability compared to the same oligonucleotides without the anchor, both in solution and incorporated into lipid membranes. Since the cholesteryl-TEG anchor lacks the characteristic properties of cholesterol, oligonucleotides modified with this anchor are equally distributed between liquid-disordered and liquid-ordered domains in \u201craft\u201d forming membranes.

This study evaluates whether this more active HIV-testing policy increased uptake of HIV testing and awareness of an HIV-positive serostatus among heterosexual attendees. Methods: In addition to routine data collected at each STI consultation, data from half-yearly HIV surveys were used from 1994 to 2004. During each survey period, 1000 consecutive attendees are enrolled voluntary and anonymously for HIV testing and are interviewed on previous HIV testing and outcome. Trends in and predictors for uptake of HIV testing as offered during routine STI consultation were analysed by logistic regression. Trends in awareness of an HIV-positive serostatus as obtained from the anonymous HIV surveys were likewise analysed. Results: The percentage of heterosexual attendees opting for an HIV test during consultation increased from 13% in 1996 to 56% in 2004. However, the proportion of individuals aware of their HIV infection did not change over time and only a minority (19%) of the 108 attendees found HIV-positive in the anonymous surveys were aware of their HIV infection. Persons being or visiting a commercial sex worker, having a non-Dutch ethnicity, lacking health insurance and having an STI diagnosed were less likely to opt for an HIV test. Conclusions: Although heterosexual attendees increased their uptake of HIV testing during STI consultation over time, uptake of testing by attendees at risk for HIV infection, such as those infected with an STI, remained low. As a result, the percentage of persons aware of their HIV infection remained low, posing a risk for their individual health and for ongoing HIV transmission.

Results: The ablated target lesion remained visible within the ablation zone in 23 (62%) of 37 of cases for a mean time of 21 \u00b1 20 weeks (median, 12 weeks). The ablation zone appeared homogeneously hyperintense on T2w turbo spin echo images on the day of IRE in 37 of 37 cases.

The rim resolved in 35 (95%) of 37 cases within 3 months. The ablation zone increased slightly over the first 48 hours, then shrank progressively. Complete healing of the ablation zone was observed in 57% (21/37) after an average of 14 \u00b1 15 (median, 8 weeks).

Aims.We have performed 3D MHD simulations of the solar radiative interior to check whether a fossil magnetic field is able to prevent the spread of the tachocline.Methods.Starting with a purely poloidal magnetic field and a latitudinal shear meant to be imposed by the convection zone at the top of the radiation zone, we have investigated the interactions between magnetic fields, rotation and shear, using the spectral code ASH on massively parallel supercomputers.Results.In all cases we have explored, the fossil field diffuses outward and ends up connecting with the convection zone, whose differential rotation is then imprinted at latitudes above \u2248 throughout the radiative interior, according to Ferraro's law of isorotation. Rotation remains uniform in the lower latitude region which is contained within closed field lines. We find that the meridional flow cannot stop the inward progression of the differential rotation. Further, we observe the development of non-axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, first due to the initial poloidal configuration of the fossil field, and later to the toroidal field produced by shearing the poloidal field through the differential rotation. We do not find dynamo action as such in the radiative interior, since the mean poloidal field is not regenerated. But the instability persists during the whole evolution, while slowly decaying with the mean poloidal field; it is probably sustained by small departures from isorotation.Conclusions.According to our numerical simulations, a fossil magnetic field cannot prevent the radiative spread of the tachocline, and thus it is unable to enforce uniform rotation in the radiation zone.

A3F and A3G are deoxycytidine deaminases that inhibit HIV-1 replication by inducing guanine-to-adenine hypermutation through deamination of cytosine to form uracil in minus-strand DNA. The effect of the simultaneous presence of both A3G and A3F on HIV-1 restriction ability is not clear. Here, we used a single-cycle infectivity assay and biochemical analyses to determine if coencapsidated A3G and A3F differ in their restriction capacity from A3G or A3F alone. Proviral DNA sequencing demonstrated that compared to each A3 enzyme alone, A3G and A3F, when combined, had a coordinate effect on hypermutation. Using size exclusion chromatography, rotational anisotropy, and in vitro deamination assays, we demonstrate that A3F promotes A3G deamination activity by forming an A3F/G hetero-oligomer in the absence of RNA which is more efficient at deaminating cytosines. Further, A3F caused the accumulation of shorter reverse transcripts due to decreasing reverse transcriptase efficiency, which would leave single-stranded minus-strand DNA exposed for longer periods of time, enabling more deamination events to occur. Although A3G and A3F are known to function alongside each other, these data provide evidence for an A3F/G hetero-oligomeric A3 with unique properties compared to each individual counterpart.IMPORTANCE The APOBEC3 enzymes APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G act as a barrier to HIV-1 replication in the absence of the HIV-1 Vif protein. After APOBEC3 enzymes are encapsidated into virions, they deaminate cytosines in minus-strand DNA, which forms promutagenic uracils that induce transition mutations or proviral DNA degradation. Even in the presence of Vif, footprints of APOBEC3-catalyzed deaminations are found, demonstrating that APOBEC3s still have discernible activity against HIV-1 in infected individuals. We undertook a study to better understand the activity of coexpressed APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G. The data demonstrate that an APOBEC3F/APOBEC3G hetero-oligomer can form that has unique properties compared to each APOBEC3 alone. This hetero-oligomer has increased efficiency of virus hypermutation, raising the idea that we still may not fully realize the antiviral mechanisms of endogenous APOBEC3 enzymes.

Postnatal immobilisation and loss of placental supply of oestrogen also contribute to skeletal demineralisation. There is no single diagnostic or screening test for MBDP, with pitfalls existing for most radiological and biochemical investigations. By reviewing the pathophysiology of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, one can establish that plasma parathyroid hormone is important in determining the aetiology of MBDP \u2013 primarily calcipaenia or phosphopaenia.

Among other functions, signalling through the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) initiates proliferation. Many microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting placental RAS mRNAs are downregulated at this time. We propose that in early gestation miRNAs that target the placental RAS are downregulated, allowing for the increased RAS expression and proliferation required for adequate placentation. HTR-8/SVneo cells (an immortalized human trophoblast cell line) were used to assess the effect of nine miRNA mimics (at 0.08, 0.16, 0.32 and 0.64 ng/\u03bcL) on trophoblast cell proliferation and predicted RAS target mRNAs. The effect of the miRNA mimics on the rate of cell proliferation was assessed using the xCELLigence real-time cell analysis system over 48 h. Levels of miRNAs and predicted RAS target mRNAs were determined by RT-PCR (qPCR, n = 9/group). Statistically different levels of expression were determined (P &lt; 0.05). All nine miRNA mimics significantly affected the proliferation rates of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Five of the miRNA mimics (miR-181a-5p (predicted to target: renin (REN), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)), miR-378 (REN, ACE), miR-663 (REN), miR-483-3p (ACE, ACE2, angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1)) and miR-514 (AGT)) were associated with a dose-dependent reduction in cell proliferation. Seven of the mimics significantly decreased expression of at least one of their predicted target RAS mRNAs. Our study shows that miRNAs targeting placental RAS mRNAs play a role in controlling trophoblast proliferation.

Compared to conventional turbomachinery component maps, the speed ratio between the two shafts is included as an additional map parameter and the torque ratio as an additional table. Dedicated component models are then developed that use these maps to simulate design and off-design operation at the component and engine levels. Using this approach, a performance model of a geared turbofan with a contra-rotating core (CRC) is created. This configuration was investigated in the context of the European program \u201cNEW Aero-Engine Core Concepts\u201d (NEWAC). The core consists of a seven-stage compressor and a two-stage turbine without interstage stators and with successive rotors running in the opposite direction through the introduction of a rotating outer spool. Such a configuration results in a reduced parts count, length, weight, and cost of the entire high pressure (HP) system. Additionally, the core efficiency is improved due to reduced cooling air flow requirements. The model is then coupled to an aircraft performance model and a typical mission is carried out. The results are compared against those of a similar configuration employing a conventional core and identical design point performance. For the given aircraft-mission combination and assuming a 10% engine weight saving when using the CRC arrangement over the conventional one, a total fuel burn reduction of 1.1% is predicted.", "title": "Modeling Contra-Rotating Turbomachinery Components for Engine Performance Simulations: The Geared Turbofan With Contra-Rotating Core Case", "id": 320}, {"journal": "Journal of Seismology", "authors": ["A.

The specific surface area of BC measured with XG and XG-GRGDS was about 200 m2/g and was almost three times less for cotton linters, 60 m2/g. The difference in the amounts of XGs adsorbed might be explained by the swollen network of bacterial cellulose and a more exposed and accessible bulk as compared to cotton linters.

Moreover, the modification in the water phase, in comparison with organic solvents, was clearly advantageous for preserving the morphology, as observed with SEM. The modification slightly increased the wettability, which might explain the decrease in or undetectable adsorption of adhesive protein shown by QCM-D. Initial cell studies showed that adhesion of human endothelial cells is enhanced when the BC hydrogel is modified with XG-GRGDS.

The preferred orientation of the surface bound protein is relevant to biointerface interactions, as the C-terminus of tropoelastin is known to be a binding target for cells. Using recombinant human tropoelastin we monitored the binding of tropoelastin on hydrophilic silica and on silica made hydrophobic by depositing a self-assembled monolayer of octadecyl trichlorosilane. The layered organization of deposited tropoelastin was probed using neutron and X-ray reflectometry under aqueous and dried conditions. In a wet environment, tropoelastin retained a solution-like structure when adsorbed on silica but adopted a brush-like structure when on hydrophobized silica. The orientation of the surface-bound tropoelastin was investigated using cell binding assays and it was found that the C-terminus of tropoelastin faced the bulk solvent when bound to the hydrophobic surface, but a mixture of orientations was adopted when tropoelastin was bound to the hydrophilic surface.

Understanding the interplay of dendritic polymer dynamics, temperature, and cargo molecule interactions should provide valuable new insight for tailoring the dendritic architecture to specific needs in nanomedicine, drug, dye, and gene delivery. Here, we have investigated polyglycerol-based core\u2013multishell (CMS) nanotransporters with incorporated Nile Red as a fluorescent drug mimetic and CMS nanotransporters with a covalently bound fluorophore (Indocarbocyanine) using fluorescence spectroscopy methods. From time-resolved fluorescence depolarization we have obtained the rotational diffusion dynamics of the incorporated dye, the nanocarrier, and its branches as a function of temperature. UV/vis and fluorescence lifetime measurements provided additional information on the local dye environment. Our results show a distribution of the cargo Nile Red within the nanotransporter shells that depends on solvent and temperature. In particular, we show that the flexibility of the polymer branches in the unimolecular state of the nanotransporter undergoes a temperature-dependent transition which correlates with a larger space for the mobility of the incorporated hydrophobic drug mimetic Nile Red and a higher probability of cargo\u2013solvent interactions at temperatures above 31 \u00b0C. The measurements have further revealed that a loss of the cargo molecule Nile Red occurred neither upon dilution of the CMS nanotransporters nor upon heating.

We demonstrate the first sub-100\u2009nm full-width-at-half-maximum visible-blind red and NIR photodetectors with state-of-the-art performance across critical response metrics. These devices are based on organic photodiodes with optically thick junctions. Paradoxically, we use broadband-absorbing organic semiconductors and utilize the electro-optical properties of the junction to create the narrowest NIR-band photoresponses yet demonstrated. In this context, these photodiodes outperform the encumbent technology (input filtered inorganic semiconductor diodes) and emerging technologies such as narrow absorber organic semiconductors or quantum nanocrystals. The design concept allows for response tuning and is generic for other spectral windows.

Some practical approaches integrated in the power-to-gas scheme to the application of natural gas decarbonization are presented. The introduction of this technology in hydrogen mobility seems to be viable, providing a carbon-free production on site without hydrogen or carbon dioxide transport and storage.

In contrast to conventional models of insurance, the insurer has a non-zero probability of insolvency which depends on the distribution of the risks, the premium rate, and the amount of capital in the company. When the insurer is insolvent, each loss reduces the indemnity available to the victims, thus generating negative pecuniary externalities. Our model shows that government-provided insurance will be more attractive in terms of expected utility, as it allows these negative pecuniary externalities to be spread equally among policyholders. However, when heterogeneous risks are introduced, a government program may be less attractive in safer areas, which could yield inefficiency if insurance ratings are not chosen appropriately.", "title": "Natural catastrophe insurance: How should the government intervene?", "id": 347}, {"journal": "International Journal of Mechanical Sciences", "authors": ["A.

Against this background, the junior physician in training, the trainer and the patient have to be meticulously selected in order to familiarize future cardiac surgeons with complex coronary anastomoses. For the advanced training of assistant cardiac surgeons it is important that certain rules are followed when creating an anastomosis. These rules are described in detail in this article. Monitoring of the graft flow by simple observation as well as by means of Doppler flow measurement is necessary. Coronary bypass surgery is nowadays carried out mostly in patients with three-vessel disease. A microsurgical technique is important for performing a complete arterial revascularization, which possibly has a survival advantage for the patient. A proven survival advantage exists for complete coronary revascularization in comparison to incomplete revascularization, therefore attention has to be paid not only to the quality but also to a suffic\u00edent number of anastomoses. The microsurgical technique described can be learned during residency, for which a structured residential procedure in the training is a prerequisite.

Five of these novel duplications are intragenic and result in larger transcript and protein products, as demonstrated through reverse transcription-PCR and western blotting. One duplication spans the entire SEPT9 gene and does not generate aberrant transcripts and proteins. The breakpoints of all the duplications are unique and contain regions of microhomology ranging from 2 to 9\u2005bp in size. The duplicated regions contain a conserved 645\u2005bp exon within SEPT9 in which HNA-linked missense mutations have been previously identified, suggesting that the region encoded by this exon is important to the pathogenesis of HNA.Conclusions Together with the previously identified founder duplication, a total of seven heterogeneous SEPT9 duplications have been identified in this study as a causative factor of HNA.

However, the adjustment of radio network parameters in a heterogeneous macro-only cellular network is a complex task, which involves a large number of configuration parameters with interactions among them. Existing commercial planning tools are based on local search methods, e.g., simulated annealing, that require problem-specific and heuristic definitions of the input parameters. The problem with local search methods is that their performance can significantly be degraded if the input parameters are misconfigured. To overcome these difficulties, an iterative optimization procedure based on Taguchi's method is proposed to find near-optimal settings. Taguchi's method was originally applied in manufacturing processes and has recently been used in several engineering fields. Unlike local search methods that heuristically discover the multidimensional parameter space of candidate solutions, Taguchi's method offers a scientifically disciplined methodology to explore the search space and select near-optimal values for the parameters. In this paper, the application of Taguchi's method in radio network optimization is illustrated by setting typical radio network parameters of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) system, i.e., the uplink power control parameters, antenna tilts, and azimuth orientations of trisectored macro base stations. Simulation results reveal that Taguchi's method is a promising approach for radio network optimization with respect to performance and computational complexity. It is shown that Taguchi's method has a comparable performance to simulated annealing in terms of power control and antenna azimuth optimizations; however, it performs better in terms of antenna tilt optimization. Moreover, it is presented that the performance of simulated annealing, as opposed to Taguchi's method, highly depends on the definition of the input parameters.", "title": "Optimizing the Radio Network Parameters of the Long Term Evolution System Using Taguchi's Method", "id": 379}, {"journal": "Lithic Technology", "authors": ["A.

Method This was an open-label, single-arm, Phase I, dose-escalation study. Results The MTD of ixabepilone [30-min, weekly IV infusion on a 21-day schedule ( N = 33)] was established at 25 mg/m 2 . Grade 3 fatigue was the DLT in 2/4 patients treated at 30 mg/m 2 . Ixabepilone was well tolerated at the MTD. Myelosuppression was rare, with no Grade 3/4 neutropenia. Due to the potential for cumulative neurotoxicity, the protocol was amended to a 1-h infusion, weekly for 3 weeks with a 1-week break. No DLT occurred at starting doses of 15, 20 and 25 mg/m 2 on this modified schedule ( N = 51), although overall toxicity was less at 15 and 20 mg/m 2 than 25 mg/m 2 . Five patients (2 on the 30-min/21-day schedule and 3 on the 60-min/28-day schedule) achieved durable objective partial responses across a variety of tumor types. Conclusions Ixabepilone had an acceptable safety profile at the MTD of 25 mg/m 2 (as a 30-min weekly infusion on a continuous 21-day schedule) and at 20 mg/m 2 (as a 1-h weekly infusion on a modified 28-day schedule).

However, differences in prescribing patterns among physicians may reflect differences in preferences or in case-mix. Furthermore, there is debate regarding the possible assumptions for point estimation using physician\u2019s preference as an instrument. Methods: A survey was sent to general practitioners (GPs) in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Ireland, Switzerland, and Germany, asking whether they would prescribe levothyroxine to eight fictitious patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. We investigated (1) whether variation in physician\u2019s preference was observable and to what extent it was explained by characteristics of GPs and their patient populations and (2) whether the data were compatible with deterministic and stochastic monotonicity assumptions. Results: Levothyroxine prescriptions varied substantially among the 526 responding GPs. Between-GP variance in levothyroxine prescriptions (logit scale) was 9.9 (95% confidence interval: 8.0, 12) in the initial mixed effects logistic model, 8.3 (6.7, 10) after adding a fixed effect for country and 8.2 (6.6, 10) after adding GP characteristics. The occurring prescription patterns falsified the deterministic monotonicity assumption. All cases in all countries were more likely to receive levothyroxine if a different case of the same GP received levothyroxine, which is compatible with the stochastic monotonicity assumption. The data were incompatible with this assumption for a different definition of the instrument. Conclusions: Our study supports the existence of physician\u2019s preference as a determinant in treatment decisions. Deterministic monotonicity will generally not be plausible for physician\u2019s preference as an instrument.

To determine whether this selection was human-exclusive or shared with other species, we performed a population genetic analysis of the pattern of nucleotide variation in non-human species, including bonobo, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. Footprints of positive selection were absent in all analyzed species, suggesting that positive selection has been recent and unique to humans. To determine which human-unique genetic changes could have been responsible for this differential evolution, the coding region of the gene was compared between human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. Only one human exclusive non-conservative change is present in the gene: Glu151Lys. This human substitution affects protein dimerization according to a three-dimensional structural model that predicts a non-negligible functional shift. This is the only candidate position at present to have been selected to fixation in humans during an episode of positive selection.

To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT intensive goal implementation, we estimated the deaths prevented and excess serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT intensive SBP treatment goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked with the National Death Index through December 2011.

Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, >1 g proteinuria, heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL\u00b7min\u22121\u00b71.73 m\u22122, or dialysis. Annual mortality rates were calculated by dividing the Kaplan-Meier 5-year mortality by 5. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and heart failure and absolute risks for serious adverse events in SPRINT were used to estimate the number of potential deaths and heart failure cases prevented and serious adverse events incurred with intensive SBP treatment.The mean age was 68.6 years, and 83.2% and 7.4% were non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black, respectively.

The computed equilibrium geometry for the A1 ground state and vibrational frequency \u03bd3 for the C\u2013I stretch mode agree well with available experimental data. The 3Q0+ state dissociating to the excited I(2P1/2) limit is found to have a minimum of 1570 cm\u22121 significantly shifted to larger internuclear distances (RC\u2013I = 5.3 a0) relative to the ground state. Similar to the CH3I case, this makes a single-exponent approximation commonly employed for analysis of the CF3I recoil dynamics unsuitable. The 4E(3A1) state possessing an allowed transition from the ground state and converging to the same atomic limit as 3Q0+ is calculated to lie too high in the Franck\u2013Condon region to have any significant impact on the A-band absorption. The computed vertical excitation energies for the 3Q1, 3Q0+, and 1Q states indicate that the A-band spectrum must lie approximately between 31\u2006300 and 45\u2006200 cm\u22121, i.e., between 220 and 320 nm.

Samples were collected 1 m behind the engine exhaust plane of the engines while they were operated at powers ranging from idle up to 30% of maximum rated thrust.Exhaust emission indices (mass emitted per kilogram of fuel used) for CO and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) were calculated based on enhancements over background relative to CO2. Emissions of all NMHCs were greatest at low power with values decreasing by an order of magnitude with increasing power. Previous studies have shown that scaling idle hydrocarbon emissions to formaldehyde or ethene (which are typically emitted at a ratio of 1-to-1 at idle) reduces variability amongst engine types. NMHC emissions were found to scale at low power, with alkenes contributing over 50% of measured NMHCs. However, as the power increases hydrocarbon emissions no longer scale to ethene, as the aromatics become the dominant species emitted. This may be due in part to a shift in combustion processes from thermal cracking (producing predominantly alkenes) to production of new molecules (producing proportionally more aromatics) as power increases. The formation of these aromatics is an intermediate step in the production of soot, which also increases with increasing power. The increase in aromatics relative to alkenes additionally results in a decrease in the hydroxyl radical reactivity and ozone formation potential of aircraft exhaust.Samples collected 30 m downwind of the engine were also analyzed for NMHCs and carbonyl compounds (acetone, 2-butanone and C1\u2013C9 aldehydes). Formaldehyde was the predominant carbonyl emitted; however, the ratio of ethene-to-formaldehyde varied between the aircraft, possibly due to the sampling of transient emissions such as engine start-up and power changes. A large portion of the measured emissions (27\u201342% by mass) in the plume samples was made up of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) with oxygenated compounds being most significant.", "title": "Power-dependent speciation of volatile organic compounds in aircraft exhaust", "id": 412}, {"journal": "Journal of Contemporary Religion", "authors": ["A.

The main aim was to develop a short and predictive predriving assessment battery. Methods. Sixty-eight consecutive stroke patients were studied who performed a mandatory predriving assessment at the Belgian Road Safety Institute, Brussels, within 18 months. Performance in a predriving assessment included medical examination (when needed), visual and neuropsychological evaluations, and an on-road test. Based on these assessments, a physician, psychologist, and the driving safety expert who administered the tests decided if a subject was either \u201cfit to drive,\u201d\u201ctemporarily unfit to drive,\u201d or \u201cunfit to drive.\u201d Results. Logistic regression analysis revealed a combination of visual neglect, figure of Rey, and on-road tests as the model that best predicted (R2 = 0.73) fitness to drive after stroke. Using a discriminant function that included the 3 tests of the logistic model, the fitness to drive judgments of 59 (86.8%) subjects were correctly predicted. The sensitivity and specificity of the predictions were 79.4% and 94.1%, respectively. Conclusion.

A discriminant equation containing the tests included in the best model was used to predict pass or fail performance on the test.Performance on 12 cognitive and three visual tests were significantly associated with performance on the road test. Five of the tests together explained 59% of the variance and predicted the pass or fail outcome of the road test with 91% accuracy, 70% sensitivity, and 97% specificity.Participants\u2019 on-road performance was more accurately predicted by the model identified in this study than using only performance on the SDSA test battery. The five psychometric/off-road tests should be used as a screening battery, after which a follow-up road test should be conducted to finally decide the fitness to drive of individuals with relapsing\u2013remitting MS.

DESIGN AND SETTING Retrospective cohort study of visits to 23 pediatric EDs in 2012 using data from the Pediatric Health Information System. PARTICIPANTS Patients <18 years old discharged following an ED visit. MEASURES The primary outcomes were the rate of return visits within 72 hours of discharge from the ED and of return visits within 72 hours resulting in hospitalization. Results: 1,415,721 of the 1,610,201 ED visits to study hospitals resulted in discharge. Of the discharges, 47,294 patients (3.3%) had a return visit. Of these revisits, 9295 (19.7%) resulted in hospitalization. In multivariate analyses, the odds of having a revisit were higher for patients with a chronic condition (odds ratio [OR]: 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.86\u20101.96), higher severity scores (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.40\u20101.45), and age <1 year (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.22\u20101.42). The odds of hospitalization on return were higher for patients with higher severity (OR: 3.42, 95% CI: 3.23\u20103.62), chronic conditions (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 2.75\u20103.10), age <1 year (1.7\u20132.5 times the odds of other age groups), overnight arrival (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.71\u20101.97), and private insurance (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.39\u20101.56).

Identifying anaphylaxis is important to providing appropriate care. A prior study showed that anaphylaxis is sometimes misdiagnosed as acute asthma in children. We sought to identify the percentage of adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with asthma exacerbations who met criteria for anaphylaxis.Methods Retrospective chart review of adults admitted with acute asthma to the ICU at Jacobi Medical Center, a Level 1 trauma centre in Bronx, New York. Study period was January 2012 to December 2014. Using the criteria outlined in the World Allergy Organization\u2019s Anaphylaxis Guidelines, we identified patients who met criteria for anaphylaxis.Results 105 patients were identified: 17 were excluded because their main reason(s) for admission was not asthma. 7 (8%) of the 88 cases eligible for the study met diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis while 3 (3.4%) were highly likely to have had anaphylaxis.

The prevalence of HRV-C among healthy children and whether this varies with ethnicity is unknown. Objective: To describe the prevalence of HRV species and their associations with demographic, environmental and socioeconomic factors in healthy Aboriginal and non- Aboriginal children. Methods: Respiratory viruses and bacteria were identified in 1006 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from a cohort of 79 Aboriginal and 88 non- Aboriginal Western Australian children before 2 years of age. HRV-positive nasopharyngeal aspirates were typed for HRV species and genotypes. Longitudinal growth models incorporating generalized estimating equations were used to investigate associations between HRV species and potential risk factors. Results: Of the 159 typed specimens, we identified 83 (52.2%) human rhinovirus species A (HRV-A), 26 (16.4%), human rhinovirus species B and 50 (31.4%) HRV-C. HRV-C was associated with upper respiratory symptoms in Aboriginal (odds ratio, 3.77; 95% confidence interval:1.05\u201313.55) and non- Aboriginal children (odds ratio, 5.85; 95% confidence interval: 2.33\u201314.66). HRV-A and HRV-C were associated with carriage of respiratory bacteria. In Aboriginal children, HRV-A was more common in the summer and in those whose mothers were employed prior to delivery. In non- Aboriginal children, day-care attendance and exclusive breast-feeding at age 6\u20138 weeks were associated with detection of HRV-A, and gestational smoking with detection of HRV-C.

It specifically addresses demanding environments, where it can reach sub microsecond precision using appropriate technologies. Its scalability is primarily limited by packet delay variations induced by packet collisions. While it is possible to avoid collisions with non-PTP packets using traffic management technologies, collision between PTP packets is an open problem in large systems with critical clock precision requirements. We propose a coordination algorithm that avoids the occurrence of such collisions. It assumes that the master clock, which is the timing reference source, can send a packet in multicast to the slaves: this is not a restrictive hypothesis, since PTP itself takes advantage of this kind of connectivity, and it is also compatible with typical wireless environments. The algorithm operates without introducing additional traffic, it ensures an upper bound to the time between two successive synchronizations of any given slave, it does not alter the structure of the standard PTP messages, it envisions a dynamic number of slaves, it tolerates the replacement of the master with a hot spare in case of failure, and does not rely on specialized hardware. The algorithm has a footprint that does not insist on activities that are already time sensitive, and its operation is mostly concentrated on the master. The algorithm inherits security and fault tolerance limits from PTP: in particular this refers to malicious nodes, and to broken devices that may jam the network.", "title": "Preventing the Collision of Requests From Slave Clocks in the Precision Time Protocol (PTP)", "id": 432}, {"journal": "Journal of Physical Chemistry C", "authors": ["A.

Support is anchored in the electricity commodity market. In contrast to this established approach, Russia intends to promote renewable energy through the capacity market. The idea is to remunerate investors for the installed capacity (MW) of their installations, in particular for the availability of their installations to produce electricity. This article argues that, contrary to the implicit consensus, a capacity-based approach to supporting renewable energy can provide an alternative to the current output-based schemes. Capacity-based schemes limit the incentive that the operators of renewable energy installations currently have under output-based schemes to deliver electricity to the grid even in periods of low demand. These schemes also provide investors with a more predictable income flow. However, to be successful, the regulation of capacity supply \u2013 currently designed for flexible power plants \u2013 needs to accommodate the specific production patterns of variable renewable energy installations.

These speech patterns were refined in the 1960s and developed into behavioural treatment programmes. The bulk of available PS treatment research has focused on speech parameters thought to reflect favourable treatment outcome. Considering this, and that post\u2010treatment relapse is known to be common, clinicians and researchers could be usefully informed by knowledge about the experiences of those who receive these treatments. Subsequently, they could use such information in attempts to control stuttering in their clients. Yet, at present, systematic research on this topic is scant.Aims: The continued development of PS treatments could be usefully informed by research into the experiences of those who use PS to control stuttering. Hence, that is the topic of the present report.Methods & Procedures: The method used was phenomenology. Participants were a purposive sample of 10 people who had received PS treatment. During a 2\u2010year period, a collaborative approach to the study of the topic was developed between the participants and interviewer. Interviews were from 1.5 to 2 hours, and a total of 34 interviews and discussions were undertaken with participants. Transcripts of these were used to generate text from which themes were identified using line\u2010by\u2010line, holistic and selective approaches.Outcomes & Results: The main findings were that even after therapy with PS there is a continued risk of stuttering occurring, and although adults have the novel experience of controlling stuttering, they also continue to experience feeling different from those who do not stutter, which may be exacerbated after therapy. Given the negative consequences associated with stuttering and feeling different, the essence of the experience after therapy with PS is that adults use their own resources to integrate behavioural skills with existing experiences in order to protect themselves from the harm of stuttering as best they can. PS changes speech, but not the dynamic and often unpredictable communication situations of everyday life. Hence, the maximum benefits of PS are attained when clients use a strategic approach to control stuttered speech and daily communication.Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the results of existing outcome research as well as with other current research from the present group. Their implications are discussed in relation to the structure of PS treatments as well as in relation to future PS outcome research. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed in terms of informing prospective clients of the experiential consequences of PS, selecting clients who might benefit from PS and in terms of assisting clients to achieve optimal benefits from PS.", "title": "Protection from harm: the experience of adults after therapy with prolonged\u2010speech", "id": 446}, {"journal": "Biological Trace Element Research", "authors": ["A.

Its urotoxicity may cause dose-limiting side effects like hemorrhagic cystitis. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during inflammation is one of the reasons of the urothelial injury. Selenoproteins play crucial roles in regulating ROS and redox status in nearly all tissues; therefore, in this study, the urotoxicity of CP and the possible protective effects of seleno-l-methionine (SLM) on urinary bladder of rats were investigated. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg CP induced cystitis, in a dose-dependent manner, as manifested by marked congestion, edema and extravasation in rat urinary bladder, a marked desquamative damage to the urothelium, severe inflammation in the lamina propria, focal erosions, and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes associated with occasional lymphocyte infiltration determined by macroscopic and histopathological examination. In rat urinary bladder tissue, a significant decrease in the endogenous antioxidant compound glutathione, and elevation of lipid peroxidation were also noted. Pretreatment with SLM (0.5 or 1 mg/kg) produced a significant decrease in the bladder edema and caused a marked decrease in vascular congestion and hemorrhage and a profound improvement in the histological structure. Moreover, SLM pretreatment decreased lipid peroxide significantly in urinary bladder tissue, and glutathione content was greatly restored. These results suggest that SLM offers protective effects against CP-induced urinary bladder toxicity and could be used as a protective agent against the drug toxicity.", "title": "Protective Effect of Seleno-l-Methionine on Cyclophosphamide-Induced Urinary Bladder Toxicity in Rats", "id": 447}, {"journal": "Biological Trace Element Research", "authors": ["A.

Articles were screened by title, abstract, and full text. Results Seventy\u2010two met the inclusion criteria. Most articles (46%) focused on breast cancer, used the PTG inventory (76%), and had a cross\u2010sectional design (68%). The PTG resulted inversely associated with depressive and anxious symptoms and directly related to hope, optimism, spirituality, and meaning. Illness\u2010related variables have been poorly investigated compared to psychological ones. Articles found no relationship between cancer site, cancer surgery, cancer recurrence, and PTG.

NIPCE requires only a small number of system evaluations, so it can be applied in cases where a Monte Carlo simulation is unfeasible. We consider three uncertain operating parameters: inlet velocity, burner plate temperature, and equivalence ratio. The FTF is identified in terms of the finite impulse response (FIR) from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with broadband velocity excitation. NIPCE yields uncertainties in the FTF due to the uncertain operating conditions. For the chosen uncertain operating bounds, a second-order expansion is found to be sufficient to represent the resulting uncertainties in the FTF with good accuracy. The effect of each operating parameter on the FTF is studied using Sobol indices, i.e., a variance-based measure of sensitivity, which are computed from the NIPCE.

For frequencies below 150\u2009Hz, the uncertainty in the gain of the FTF is also attributable to the uncertainty in equivalence-ratio, but for higher frequencies, the uncertainties in velocity and temperature dominate.

In this communication, we study a model high efficiency OSC system (PCDTBT/PC70BM) as a function of active layer thickness, blend composition and processing. The spectral shapes of the measured EQEs show strong thickness and blend ratio dependence. However, when correctly determined, the internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) are spectrally flat.

This result was established in a previous paper where we calculated both the Casimir pressure within a region of vacuum simulating a hadronic bag and the Wilson factor for the three-index potential associated with the boundary of the bag. The resulting \u201cvolume law\u201d satisfied by the Wilson loop is consistent with the basic confining requirement that the static interquark potential increases with the distance between two test charges. As a sequel to that paper, we consider here the coupling of A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 to the generic current of a matter field, later identified with the spin density current of a Dirac field. In fact, one of the objectives of this paper is to investigate the impact of the quantum fluctuations of A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 on the effective dynamics of the spinor field. The consistency of the field equations, even at the classical level, requires the introduction of a mass term for A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1. In this case, the Casimir vacuum pressure includes a contribution that is explicitly dependent on the mass of A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 and leads us to conclude that the mass term plays the same role as the infrared cutoff needed to regularize the finite volume partition functional previously calculated in the massless case. Remarkably, even in the presence of a mass term, A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 contains a mixture of massless and massive spin-0 fields so that the resulting equation is still gauge invariant. This is yet another peculiar, but physically relevant property of A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 since it is reflected in the effective dynamics of the spinor fields and confirms the confining property of A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 already expected from the earlier calculation of the Wilson loop.", "title": "Quantum effects of a massive 3-form coupled to a Dirac field", "id": 464}, {"journal": "Physical Review D", "authors": ["A.

Partial monitoring by an observer implies that there may exist records unobserved by that observer. It was shown that, given only the observed record, the observer can better estimate the underlying true quantum states, by inferring the unobserved record and using quantum state smoothing, rather than the usual quantum filtering approach. However, the improvement in estimation fidelity, originally examined for a resonantly driven qubit coupled to two vacuum baths, was also shown to vary depending on the types of detection used for the qubit's fluorescence. In this work, we analyse this variation in a systematic way for the first time. We first define smoothing power using an average purity recovery and a relative average purity recovery, of smoothing over filtering. Then, we explore the power for various combinations of fluorescence detection for both observed and unobserved channels. We next propose a method to explain the variation of the smoothing power, based on multi-time correlation strength between fluorescence detection records.

The tomographic reconstruction utilizes only a continuous weak probe of a single qubit observable, a fixed coupling Hamiltonian, together with single-qubit controls. In the single qubit case, a combination of the continuous measurement of an observable and a Rabi oscillation is sufficient to find all three unknown qubit state components. For two interacting qubits, where only one observable of the first qubit is measured, the control Hamiltonian can be implemented to transfer all quantum information to the measured observable, via the qubit-qubit interaction and Rabi oscillation controls applied locally on each qubit. We discuss different sets of controls by analyzing the unitary dynamics and the Fisher information matrix of the estimation in the limit of weak measurement, and simulate tomographic results numerically.

RNAP III transcribes hundreds of tRNA genes and fewer additional short RNA genes. We survey recent work on transcription by RNAP III including an atomic structure, mechanisms of action, interactions with chromatin and retroposons, and a conserved link between its activity and a tRNA modification that enhances mRNA decoding. Other new work suggests important mechanistic connections to oxidative stress, autoimmunity and cancer, embryonic stem cell pluripotency, and tissue-specific developmental effects.

RNA polymerase (RNAP) III synthesizes all tRNAs in eukaryotes and it derepression is associated with cancer. Maf1 is a conserved general repressor of RNAP III under the control of the target of rapamycin (TOR) that acts to integrate transcriptional output and protein synthetic demand toward metabolic economy. Studies in budding yeast have indicated that the global tRNA gene activation that occurs with derepression of RNAP III via maf1-deletion is accompanied by a paradoxical loss of tRNA-mediated nonsense suppressor activity, manifested as an antisuppression phenotype, by an unknown mechanism. We show that maf1-antisuppression also occurs in the fission yeast S. pombe amidst general activation of RNAP III. We used tRNA-HydroSeq to document that little changes occurred in the relative levels of different tRNAs in maf1\u0394 cells. By contrast, the efficiency of N2,N2-dimethyl G26 (m22G26) modification on certain tRNAs was decreased in response to maf1-deletion and associated with antisuppression, and was validated by other methods. Over-expression of Trm1, which produces m22G26, reversed maf1-antisuppression. A model that emerges is that competition by increased tRNA levels in maf1\u0394 cells leads to m22G26 hypomodification due to limiting Trm1, reducing the activity of suppressor-tRNASerUCA and accounting for antisuppression. Consistent with this, we show that RNAP III mutations associated with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy decrease tRNA transcription, increase m22G26 efficiency and reverse antisuppression. Extending this more broadly, we show that a decrease in tRNA synthesis by treatment with rapamycin leads to increased m22G26 modification and that this response is conserved among highly divergent yeasts and human cells.", "title": "RNA Polymerase III Output Is Functionally Linked to tRNA Dimethyl-G26 ModificationWhy tRNAs overproduced in the absence of Maf1, negative regulator of RNAPIII, are not fully functional?", "id": 476}, {"journal": "Energy Policy", "authors": ["A.

It is considered that electrons are injected into the mechanism in test-particle regime directly from the high energy tail of the downstream Maxwellian distribution function. The model can be applied to most of the observed SNRs because the majority of detected SNRs are shell-types and have a more or less spherical shape and are sources of nonthermal radio emission. It is shown that the model successfully explains the many averaged observational properties of evolved shell-type SNRs. In particular, the radio surface brightness (\u03a3) evolves with diameter as , while the bounding shock is strong (Mach number is ), followed by steep decrease (steeper than ) for . Such evolution of the surface brightness with diameter and its strong dependence on the environmental parameters strongly reduce the usefulness of relations as a tool for determining the distances to SNRs. The model predicts no radio emission from SNRs in the late radiative stage of evolution and the existence of radio-quiet but relatively active SNRs is possible. Our model easily explains very large-diameter radio sources such as the Galactic Loops and the candidates for Hypernova radio remnants. The model predicts that most of the observed SNRs with are located in a tenuous phase of the ISM. The model also predicts the existence of a population of pc SNRs with if the kinetic energy of the explosion is erg. From the comparison of the model results with the statistics of evolved shell-type SNRs, we were able to estimate the fraction of electrons accelerated from the thermal pool in the range .

The bulk 187Os/188Os and HSE mass fractions of the synthetic sulfides were independently determined after high pressure asher (HPA) digestion and conventional HSE separation (Os solvent extraction and Ir, Ru, Pt, Pd, Re separation via anion exchange chromatography), while the homogenous distribution of HSE was assessed via LA-ICP-MS.Tests were performed following the protocol of Pearson et al. (1998), where sulfides are digested in H2SO4/CrO3 and Os is simultaneously extracted as OsO4. Additional tests were performed adding a pre-digestion step in HBr and/or HCl. The duration and the temperature of the pre-digestion and micro-distillation steps, as well as different chromatographic separations of the HSE were also evaluated. While the majority of the tests yielded 187Os/188Os in agreement with that obtained after HPA digestion, HSE mass fractions show large deviations from the reference content, depending on the used procedure. Such variations are interpreted as the result of incomplete sulfide digestion, Os spike loss, and the possible presence of undigested sub-micrometric platinum group minerals (PGM). Overall, the bulk sulfide HSE mass fractions obtained after HPA digestion are best reproduced (mean deviations \u226410%) using a pre-digestion step in HBr\u202f+\u202fHCl at 120\u202f\u00b0C.This study highlights the need for matrix-matched sulfide reference materials for routine use in laboratories determining HSE mass fractions and Os isotope ratios on single BMS grains.

Despite the economy and demonstrated scalability of hydroformylation, the enantioselective process (asymmetric hydroformylation, AHF) currently does not contribute significantly to the production of chiral aldehydes and their derivatives. Current impediments to practical application of AHF include low diversity of chiral ligands that provide effective rates and selectivities, limited exploration of substrate scope, few demonstrations of efficient flow reactor processes, and incomplete mechanistic understanding of the factors that control reaction selectivity and rate. This Account summarizes developments in ligand design, substrate scope, reactor technology, and mechanistic understanding that advance AHF toward practical and atom-efficient production of chiral \u03b1-stereogenic aldehydes.Initial applications of AHF were limited to activated terminal alkenes such as styrene, but recent developments enable high selectivity for unactivated olefins and more complex substrates such as 1,1\u2032- and 1,2-disubstituted alkenes. Expanded substrate scope primarily results from new chiral phosphine ligands, especially phospholanes and bisdiazaphospholanes (BDPs). These ligands are now more accessible due to improved synthesis and resolution procedures. One of the virtues of diazaphospholanes is the relative ease of derivatization, including attachment to heterogeneous supports. Hydroformylation involves toxic and flammable reactants, a serious concern in pharmaceutical production facilities. Flow reactors offer many process benefits for handling dangerous reagents and for systematically moving from research to production scales. New approaches to achieving good gas\u2013liquid mixing in flow reactors have been demonstrated with BDP-derived catalyst systems and lend assurance that AHF can be practically implemented by the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries.To date, progress in AHF has been empirically driven, because hydroformylation is a complex, multistep process for which the origins of chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity are difficult to elucidate. Mechanistic complexity arises from three concurrent catalytic cycles (linear and two diastereomeric branched paths), significant pooling of catalyst as off-cycle species, and multiple elementary steps that are kinetically competitive. Addressing such complexity requires new approaches to collecting kinetic and extra-kinetic information and analyzing these data. In this Account, we describe our group\u2019s progress toward understanding the complex kinetics and mechanism of AHF as catalyzed by rhodium bis(diazaphospholane) catalysts. Our strategy features both \u201coutside-in\u201d (i.e., monitoring catalytic rates and selectivities as a function of reactant concentration and temperature) and \u201cinside-out\u201d (i.e., building kinetic models based on the rates of component steps of the catalytic reaction) approaches. These studies include isotopic labeling, interception and characterization of catalytic intermediates using NMR techniques, multinuclear high-pressure NMR spectroscopy, and sophisticated kinetic modeling.

Endothelin-1 (ET-1; 0.1-100.0 nM) caused graded tonic contractions with a CK50 (concentration causing response equivalent to 50% of KC1 80 mM) of 3.4 nM and EH (response to highest concentration) of 186 \u00b1 22, being 40-fold less potent than cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8), 103-fold more potent than carbachol, but equipotent to ET-3, sarafotoxin S6c (S6c) and IRL 1620. The selective ETA receptor antagonists BQ-123 (3 \u03bcM) and A-127722-5 (0.3 \u03bcM) did not block responses to ET-1, but BQ-123 depressed responses to 30-100 nM ET-3 by about 35%. The ETB receptor antagonist BQ-788 (1 \u03bcM) shifted the curve to S6c by only fivefold. In rabbit aorta and at these same concentrations, BQ-123 and A-127722-5 markedly shifted (\u2265 100-fold) the curve for ET-1-induced contraction , whereas BQ-788 shifted that for S6c 40-fold. Higher concentrations of all three antagonists contracted the RGB. Thus, although RGB responses to ETs and selective ETB receptor agonists seem to be largely mediated via ETB receptors, they are remarkably insensitive to blockade by both selective ETA and ETB receptor antagonists, as previously reported in the guinea pig gallbladder . Finally, through yet unknown mechanisms, high concentrations of ET receptor antagonists induce marked RGB contractions. It remains to be seen whether this finding is predictive of adverse biliary tract side-effects of such drugs in the clinic.

The computed historical sedimentation rates are found to be within the range of measured data, which suggests that fine suspended sediment concentrations in the early 1800s were comparable to contemporary ones.

U-series disequilibria measured in magmas erupted in the past 18 years at Stromboli volcano provide the first geochemical evidence of the involvement of antemelt and help constraining the timescales of the processes occurring in the plumbing system of the volcano. Despite almost constant major and trace element composition, significant variations in isotope ratios are observed. (230Th/232Th) decreases with time, whilst (238U/232Th), (226Ra/230Th) and 87Sr/86Sr are different in the two types of magma erupted. Magma with low phenocryst content (lp) is erupted as pumices during paroxysm and is thought to belong to a deep reservoir. Highly porphyritic magma (hp) is erupted during the normal \u201cStrombolian\u201d activity as scoria and during the effusive events as lavas, and it is considered to derive from the former one within a shallow reservoir through degassing-driven crystallisation, mixing and incorporation of antecrysts. The distinct (238U/232Th) of lp and hp magma requires the involvement of a component with high 87Sr/86Sr and (238U/232Th) deriving from older magmas erupted earlier in the volcano history (up to 2.5 ka). The incompatibility of U and Th in major mineral phases limits the possible effect of antecrysts, hence requiring the involvement of a U- and Th-rich antemelt. The decrease of 226Ra-excess from lp to hp magmas provides further and independent evidence for the involvement of a few thousands years old antemelt.The variation with time of (230Th/232Th) within lp and hp magmas is exploited to constrain the residence time of magmas in the deep and shallow reservoir of the volcano to &lt;55yrs (inferred reservoir volume &lt;0.5km3) and 2\u201310 yrs (inferred reservoir volume 0.02\u20130.09km3), respectively.

We show that, while most of the magma is erupted within few years, a portion of it, made of both crystals (antecrysts) and residual liquid (antemelt), can be stored in the plumbing system for thousands of years to be eventually rejuvenated and mixed back into the shallow reservoir. The presence of antemelts may also affect the eruptive mechanism by promoting heat transfer in locked crystal mushes, hence favouring their remobilisation.U-series at Stromboli reveals recycling of \u223c2ka interstitial melts (antemelts).We provide the fist geochemical evidences of recycled antemelt from crystal mush.Antemelts may provide a new interpretation for U-series in volcanic systems.Estimated residence times of magma are shorter than few tens of years.Thus, processes at different timescales operates within the same magmatic system.The presence of crystal mushes in the feeding system of active volcanoes is generally revealed by antecrysts, representing the crystalline portion of old magmas recycled in the juvenile material, but very little is known about the fate of interstitial liquid hosted within the crystal-rich mush (i.e. antemelt). U-series disequilibria measured in magmas erupted in the past 18 years at Stromboli volcano provide the first geochemical evidence of the involvement of antemelt and help constraining the timescales of the processes occurring in the plumbing system of the volcano. Despite almost constant major and trace element composition, significant variations in isotope ratios are observed. (230Th/232Th) decreases with time, whilst (238U/232Th), (226Ra/230Th) and 87Sr/86Sr are different in the two types of magma erupted. Magma with low phenocryst content (lp) is erupted as pumices during paroxysm and is thought to belong to a deep reservoir. Highly porphyritic magma (hp) is erupted during the normal \u201cStrombolian\u201d activity as scoria and during the effusive events as lavas, and it is considered to derive from the former one within a shallow reservoir through degassing-driven crystallisation, mixing and incorporation of antecrysts. The distinct (238U/232Th) of lp and hp magma requires the involvement of a component with high 87Sr/86Sr and (238U/232Th) deriving from older magmas erupted earlier in the volcano history (up to 2.5 ka). The incompatibility of U and Th in major mineral phases limits the possible effect of antecrysts, hence requiring the involvement of a U- and Th-rich antemelt. The decrease of 226Ra-excess from lp to hp magmas provides further and independent evidence for the involvement of a few thousands years old antemelt.The variation with time of (230Th/232Th) within lp and hp magmas is exploited to constrain the residence time of magmas in the deep and shallow reservoir of the volcano to &lt;55yrs (inferred reservoir volume &lt;0.5km3) and 2\u201310 yrs (inferred reservoir volume 0.02\u20130.09km3), respectively.

Cypermethrin (CYP) is one of the most widely used pyrethroid insecticides against different pests, and its use causes soil contamination. The aim of this study was to investigate the removal of CYP from contaminated soil by Plantago major (PM) and some surfactants. For the first time, we documented the uptake and translocation of CYP from the soil and used some strategies to improve the effectiveness of this technology, which involved the use of various surfactants to solubilize the contaminant. In a pot experiment, four surfactants [liquid silicon dioxide (SiO 2 , 750 mg L \u22121 ), 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP\u00dfCD, 1%), humic acid (HA, 10 mg L \u22121 ) and Tween 80 (Tw80, 9.2 mg L \u22121 )] were used to facilitate the phytoremediation of CYP (10 \u00b5g g \u22121 )-contaminated soil by PM. Results Our data showed that amending the soil with PM plus SiO 2 significantly reduced the amount of CYP in the soil and highly increased the concentrations of CYP in the plant roots and leaves. The longest half-life value ( t 1/2 ) of CYP was in the sterilized soil treatment (24.8 days), and the shortest was in the soil with PM amended with SiO 2 (6.41 days). The half-life value ( t 1/2 ) of CYP in soil with PM alone was 10.0 days. Through in vitro experiments, a batch equilibrium technique showed that hydroxypropyl-\u00df-cyclodextrin (HP\u00dfCD) is the best surfactant to most efficiently eliminate CYP from the soil. However, in the greenhouse experiment, the addition of SiO 2 to soil cultivated with PM was more effective than the use of other solubility-enhancing surfactants in the removal of significant amounts of CYP ( p >\u20090.05) from the contaminated soil.

Anderson"], "abstract": "The use of alternative fuels for aviation is likely to increase due to concerns over fuel security, price stability, and the sustainability of fuel sources. Concurrent reductions in particulate emissions from these alternative fuels are expected because of changes in fuel composition including reduced sulfur and aromatic content. The NASA Alternative Aviation Fuel Experiment (AAFEX) was conducted in January\u2013February 2009 to investigate the effects of synthetic fuels on gas-phase and particulate emissions. Standard petroleum JP-8 fuel, pure synthetic fuels produced from natural gas and coal feedstocks using the Fischer\u2013Tropsch (FT) process, and 50% blends of both fuels were tested in the CFM-56 engines on a DC-8 aircraft. To examine plume chemistry and particle evolution with time, samples were drawn from inlet probes positioned 1, 30, and 145 m downstream of the aircraft engines. No significant alteration to engine performance was measured when burning the alternative fuels. However, leaks in the aircraft fuel system were detected when operated with the pure FT fuels as a result of the absence of aromatic compounds in the fuel. Dramatic reductions in soot emissions were measured for both the pure FT fuels (reductions in mass of 86% averaged over all powers) and blended fuels (66%) relative to the JP-8 baseline with the largest reductions at idle conditions. At 7% power, this corresponds to a reduction from 7.6 mg kg\u22121 for JP-8 to 1.2 mg kg\u22121 for the natural gas FT fuel. At full power, soot emissions were reduced from 103 to 24 mg kg\u22121 (JP-8 and natural gas FT, respectively). The alternative fuels also produced smaller soot (e.g., at 85% power, volume mean diameters were reduced from 78 nm for JP-8 to 51 nm for the natural gas FT fuel), which may reduce their ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The reductions in particulate emissions are expected for all alternative fuels with similar reductions in fuel sulfur and aromatic content regardless of the feedstock. As the plume cools downwind of the engine, nucleation-mode aerosols form. For the pure FT fuels, reductions (94% averaged over all powers) in downwind particle number emissions were similar to those measured at the exhaust plane (84%). However, the blended fuels had less of a reduction (reductions of 30\u201344%) than initially measured (64%). The likely explanation is that the reduced soot emissions in the blended fuel exhaust plume results in promotion of new particle formation microphysics, rather than coating on pre-existing soot particles, which is dominant in the JP-8 exhaust plume. Downwind particle volume emissions were reduced for both the pure (79 and 86% reductions) and blended FT fuels (36 and 46%) due to the large reductions in soot emissions. In addition, the alternative fuels had reduced particulate sulfate production (near zero for FT fuels) due to decreased fuel sulfur content. To study the formation of volatile aerosols (defined as any aerosol formed as the plume ages) in more detail, tests were performed at varying ambient temperatures (\u22124 to 20 \u00b0C). At idle, particle number and volume emissions were reduced linearly with increasing ambient temperature, with best fit slopes corresponding to \u22128 \u00d7 1014 particles (kg fuel)\u22121 \u00b0C\u22121 for particle number emissions and \u221210 mm3 (kg fuel)\u22121 \u00b0C\u22121 for particle volume emissions. The temperature dependency of aerosol formation can have large effects on local air quality surrounding airports in cold regions. Aircraft-produced aerosols in these regions will be much larger than levels expected based solely on measurements made directly at the engine exit plane. The majority (90% at idle) of the volatile aerosol mass formed as nucleation-mode aerosols, with a smaller fraction as a soot coating. Conversion efficiencies of up to 2.8% were measured for the partitioning of gas-phase precursors (unburned hydrocarbons and SO2) to form volatile aerosols.

Introduction In the era of evidence-based medicine (EBM), randomized studies and meta-analyses have the highest level of evidence; however, Sackett, who coined the phrase \u201cevidence-based medicine\u201d also had other things in mind. Material and methods Randomized trials, registries, and meta-analyses are evaluated for their methodology and for potential flaws that could hinder the generation of medical evidence. Moreover, certain things cannot be studied in randomized trials. The EBM should be used for a single patient and therefore patient informed consent has to be obtained. Therefore, the patient\u2019s thoughts and wishes are an important part of EBM. Results Randomized studies are usually carried out on small, carefully chosen patient groups with defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Therefore, they cannot always be generalized to a broad patient spectrum but can only be valid for certain patients. Meta-analyses are based on statistical calculations and assumptions but are not better than those studies they depend on. One problem is that generating meta-analyses with huge patient numbers means that statistically relevant differences can be calculated that are possibly clinically irrelevant. Registries are often filled with large patient numbers and include primary data. This makes generalization easier but not assumptions about certain subgroups of patients because registries often include heterogeneous patient groups.

Lung explant cultures were prepared from 3-day-old neonatal rat pups and exposed to room air or 95% O2 for 72 h. Western blots and immunohistochemistry were used to determine if hyperoxia stimulated IGF-1 and IGF-1R, and to identify the cell types involved.

After recalling Vygtotsky\u2019s core ideas, we suggest that religion, as cultural and symbolic system, participates to the orchestration of human activities and sense-making. Such orchestration works both from within the person, through internalized values and ideas, and from without, through the person\u2019s interactions with others, discourses, cultural objects etc. This leads us to consider religions as supporting various forms of dialogical dynamics\u2014intra-psychological dialogues, interpersonal with present, absent or imaginary others, as well as inter-group dialogues\u2014which we illustrate with empirical vignettes.

Methods: One hundred patients with suspected RAS undergoing renal angiography were included. PTRA was performed if the trans-stenotic mean arterial pressure gradient was \u226510 mmHg. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), neopterin , CD40 ligand (CD40L) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were measured before, and 1 day and 1 month after PTRA ( n = 61) or diagnostic angiography only ( n = 39). Results: At baseline there were no significant differences in inflammatory biomarkers or ET-1 levels between patients subsequently undergoing PTRA or angiography only. After angiography, IL-6 and hs-CRP had increased in both groups compared to baseline ( P < 0.001).

We explored the attitudes and beliefs of dental staff about the factors that helped or hindered the establishment and implementation of a hospital\u2010based parent counselling program to manage existing, and prevent new, carious lesions in children. A further aim was to explore the influence of the program on the hospital's reorientation to prevention. Methods Eight of nine program staff participated in two focus group interviews, and two co\u2010ordinating staff participated in semi\u2010structured interviews.

Results The participants identified a number of factors that they felt influenced the establishment and implementation of the program, including the dental team's support of the initiative, the advantages of building on existing clinic infrastructure and procedures, the utility of harnessing dental assistants as a resource for oral health promotion, and the confidence of dental professionals to provide parent counselling. Conclusion Efforts to establish a preventive program in a public paediatric dental service should ensure that all members of the dental team are engaged during all phases of the program, that dental assistants are trained and supported to deliver parent counselling, and that interprofessional partnerships with services such as dietetics are fostered.

The prevalence of RV species among HIV-infected children in South Africa is unknown.To describe the prevalence of respiratory viruses, including RV species, associated with HIV status and other clinical symptoms in children less than two years of age with and without ALRI in Pretoria, South Africa.Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 105 hospitalized ALRI cases and 53 non-ALRI controls less than two years of age. HIV status was determined. Common respiratory viruses were identified by PCR, and RV species and genotypes were identified by semi-nested PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyses.Respiratory viruses were more common among ALRI cases than controls (83.8% vs. 69.2%; p = 0.041).

Women were more likely than men to render a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. When the plaintiff was a victim of individual discrimination, men and women awarded comparable remedies but when the plaintiff was a victim of institutional sexism, women awarded significantly more remedies than men.

In 2005, Neff et al ( Mund Kiefer Gesichtschir 2005;9:80), supported by a previous experimental work, reported a successful clinical study of condylar head fractures treated by a retroauricular approach ; this article is in German, and the later English-language literature does not mention about this approach to open reduction and internal fixation of mandibular condylar fractures. The retroauricular transmeatal access , selected and performed by the senior author to treat 14 patients affected by highly located condylar head fracture, is illustrated in details. Methods: We collected data of 14 consecutive adult patients who, after the discussion about all options, had consented to have 16 mandibular condylar head fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation by miniplates and screws via a retroauricular transmeatal approach. We exposed the temporomandibular joint area easily and better by dissecting via a retroauricular route with identification, ligation, and transection of the retromandibular vein; because of the posterior access, the frontal branch of the facial nerve and the auriculotemporal nerve are located and protected within the substance of the anteriorly retracted flap, superficial to the retromandibular vein. The follow-up clinical examination showed temporary weakness of the frontal branch of the facial nerve in 1 case with a recovery to normal function of 1.6 months; no patients had permanent weakness of the facial nerve or injury of the auriculotemporal nerve. There was absence of any salivary fistula, sialocele, and Frey syndrome; hearing was preserved in all cases, without any auditory stenosis or aesthetic deformity, and there was absence of any infections, hematoma, or scarring. Conclusions: Retroauricular approach provides good exposure of the temporomandibular joint and satisfactory protection from nerve injuries and vascular lesions, allowing an adequate osteosynthesis.

Blood samples were collected for HIV and malaria testing, blood culture and full blood counts, and a chest X\u2010ray was performed. A panel of common respiratory viruses was investigated using two independent multiplex RT\u2010PCR assays with primers specific for each virus and viral type. RV species and genotypes were identified by seminested PCR assays, sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyses. Results At least one respiratory virus was identified in 206 (74.4%) children hospitalised with clinical pneumonia. RV was the most common virus identified in both HIV\u2010infected (17 of 38, 44.7%) and HIV\u2010uninfected (74 of 237, 31.2%; P = 0.100) children.

Of these processes, the tryptophan photosensitization induced by methylene blue has been well studied. A predominant type II photosensitizing activity, mediated by singlet oxygen, has been already demonstrated on various models. The purpose of this study is to compare this photosensitization system with that induced by naproxen, belonging to the class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. For this compound, a type I (radical) and type II (singlet oxygen) cooperative mechanism of photoinduced damage was previously proposed. This study represents an example of testing drugs on the simple experimental model of amino acid residues in proteins. Particular emphasis is dedicated to modifications caused by the formation of drug photomediated toxic species, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). This is achieved following the kinetics of photodegradation of the sensitizers and of the amino acid, as well as the formation of their photoproducts and by evaluation of quantum yields of the various processes. Tryptophan photoproducts represent biomarkers of oxidative damage indicative for protein photooxidation and for the molecular mechanism of photosensitization; some of these have been identified for the first time as UVA photosensitization products. The pattern of Trp photoproducts formed by the two compounds differs and is specific for each type of sensitization process. These observations support extending the investigation to systems of increasing molecular complexity, that is Trp in isolated proteins and in cells and represent an effort to provide a simplified rationale of the complex picture coming out from literature data and our experimental results.", "title": "Role of aromatic amino acid tryptophan UVA-photoproducts in the determination of drug photosensitization mechanism: a comparison between methylene blue and naproxen", "id": 558}, {"journal": "American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology", "authors": ["A.

In November 2014 Rosetta delivered the lander Philae to perform the first soft landing ever on the surface of a comet. The critical landing operations have been conducted with remarkable accuracy and will constitute one of the most important achievements in the history of spaceflight.After this critical operation, Rosetta began the escort phase of the comet in its journey in the Solar System heading to the perihelion, reached in August 2015. Throughout this period, the comet environment kept changing with increasing gas and dust emissions. A first phase of bound orbits was followed by a sequence of complex flyby segments which allowed the scientific instruments to perform in depth investigation of the comet environment and nucleus. The unpredictable nature of the comet activity forced the mission control team to implement unplanned changes to the flight plan prepared for this mission phase and to plan the whole mission in a more dynamic way than originally conceived.This paper describes the details of the landing operations and of the main comet escort phase.

The main mission objectives were to perform close observations of the comet nucleus throughout its orbit around the Sun and deliver the lander Philae to its surface. This paper describers the activities at mission operations level that allowed the landing of Philae.The landing preparation phase was mainly characterised by the definition of the landing selection process, to which several parties contributed, and by the definition of the strategy for comet characterisation, the orbital strategy for lander delivery, and the definition and validation of the operations timeline.The definition of the landing site selection process involved almost all components of the mission team; Rosetta has been the first, and so far only mission, that could not rely on data collected by previous missions for the landing site selection. This forced the teams to include an intensive observation campaign as a mandatory part of the process; several science teams actively contributed to this campaign thus making results from science observations part of the mandatory operational products. The time allocated to the comet characterisation phase was in the order of a few weeks and all the processes, tools, and interfaces required an extensive planning an validation. Being the descent of Philae purely ballistic, the main driver for the orbital strategy was the capability to accurately control the position and velocity of Rosetta at Philae\u2019s separation. The resulting operations timeline had to merge this need of frequent orbit determination and control with the complexity of the ground segment and the inherent risk of problems when doing critical activities in short times.This paper describes the contribution of the Mission Control Centre (MOC) at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) to this mission phase and the lessons learned that can be derived from this experience.", "title": "Rosetta mission operations for landing", "id": 562}, {"journal": "Acta Astronautica", "authors": ["A.

The type II photosensitizing activity of Rufloxacin has been already demonstrated on calf thymus DNA and free nucleosides. The aim of this study is to examine in control untreated and UVA irradiated human fibroblasts the modifications on DNA status induced by Rufloxacin added in the culture medium. This allows to investigate the photosensitizing activity of Rufloxacin in a more complex cell model. Fibroblasts, either in the presence or in the absence of Rufloxacin, were exposed to UVA irradiation for different times. An experimental protocol was followed in order to evaluate the amount of single-strand breaks (SSB) and double-strand breaks (DSB) DNA fragmentation by comet assay, and plasmid photocleavage. The presence of oxidized bases was also evaluated using the 8-OH-dGuo test. The comet assay test was also employed to assess cellular repair capacity. The intracellular drug concentration was verified by HPLC-MS. The results confirming the role of Rufloxacin as photosensitizer were: (i) a time-dependent increase in DNA fragmentation when fibroblasts were irradiated in the presence of Rufloxacin; (ii) the efficiency of the cellular repair machinery to be exhaustive after 2 h (whereas no correlation between irradiation time and DNA damage repair was observed with a higher level of DNA fragmentation after shorter irradiation times); (iii) the increased number of cells exhibiting high DNA fragmentation, seen as comets with long tails, was not accompanied by a similar large extent of oxidised DNA base formation, as measured by 8-OH-dGuo analysis; (iv) the double helix SSB, formed in plasmid photosensitization, agreed with the comet assay results, pointing out a good correlation among the cell system and the simpler models used.", "title": "Rufloxacin induced photosensitization in bio-models of increasing complexity", "id": 565}, {"journal": "Photochemical and Photobiological Sciences", "authors": ["A.

Intercellular communication between AWC and other neurons in a transient NSY-5 gap junction network antagonizes voltage-activated calcium channels, UNC-2 (CaV2) and EGL-19 (CaV1), in the AWCON cell, but how calcium signaling is downregulated by NSY-5 is only partly understood. Here, we show that voltage- and calcium-activated SLO BK potassium channels mediate gap junction signaling to inhibit calcium pathways for asymmetric AWC differentiation. Activation of vertebrate SLO-1 channels causes transient membrane hyperpolarization, which makes it an important negative feedback system for calcium entry through voltage-activated calcium channels. Consistent with the physiological roles of SLO-1, our genetic results suggest that slo-1 BK channels act downstream of NSY-5 gap junctions to inhibit calcium channel-mediated signaling in the specification of AWCON. We also show for the first time that slo-2 BK channels are important for AWC asymmetry and act redundantly with slo-1 to inhibit calcium signaling. In addition, nsy-5-dependent asymmetric expression of slo-1 and slo-2 in the AWCON neuron is necessary and sufficient for AWC asymmetry. SLO-1 and SLO-2 localize close to UNC-2 and EGL-19 in AWC, suggesting a role of possible functional coupling between SLO BK channels and voltage-activated calcium channels in AWC asymmetry. Furthermore, slo-1 and slo-2 regulate the localization of synaptic markers, UNC-2 and RAB-3, in AWC neurons to control AWC asymmetry. We also identify the requirement of bkip-1, which encodes a previously identified auxiliary subunit of SLO-1, for slo-1 and slo-2 function in AWC asymmetry.

Due to the difference in image acquisition parameters, dose calculated in a CBCT can differ from planned dose. We evaluate the difference between dose calculation in kV CBCT and simulation CT, and the effect of HU\u2010density tables in dose discrepancies Methods: HU values for various materials were obtained using a Catphan 504 phantom for a simulator CT (CTSIM) and two different OBI systems using three imaging protocols: Head, Thorax and Pelvis. HU\u2010density tables were created in the TPS for each OBI image protocol. Treatment plans were made on each Catphan 504 dataset and on the head, thorax and pelvis sections of an anthropomorphic phantom, with and without the respective HU\u2010density table.

Results: Dose calculations carried on the Catphan 504 CBCTs, with and without the respective CT\u2010density table, had a maximum difference of \u22120.65% from the values on the planning CT.

We investigate the accuracy of various commonly used bolus materials to incorporate flash in VMAT WBI plans while minimizing the perturbation near the skin. Methods: We obtained a CT\u2010simulation of an anthropomorphic phantom with a breast attachment. Three VMAT plans were created with different boluses: 1 cm of 1 g/cm3 bolus (Superflab), 1 cm of 0.65 g/cm3 bolus (wet towels), and 1 cm of g/cm3 bolus with 2 dose levels accounting for the difference between bolus and tissue density. The PTV was extended into the bolus, outside the patient body contour to incorporate flash. OSLDs were used to obtain surface doses at the medial, lateral and tip sites of the breast. Each plan was irradiated four times using CBCT for positioning and dosimeter localization. Results: The average thickness of the wet\u2010towel bolus on delivery was 8 mm with a CBCT\u2010measured density of 0.6 g/cm3.

The largest dose fluctuations occurred near areas where the bolus failed to properly conform to the breast contour.

At this point, the phase transition is discontinuous and the surfaces belong to the compact directed percolation universality class. The relabeling of space-time points in the nonsymmetric scheme alters significantly the surface growth, changing the values of the critical exponents. The critical behavior of rough surfaces at the nonchaotic-chaotic transition is also studied using the damage spreading technique; the exponents confirm DP values for the symmetric scheme.", "title": "Scaling exponents of rough surfaces generated by the Domany-Kinzel cellular automaton", "id": 581}, {"journal": "ArXiv Computer Science", "authors": ["A.

In this work, we present SecSens, a novel approach for secure nonlinear state estimation in the presence of modeling and measurement noise. SecSens consists of two independent algorithms, namely, SecEKF and SecOPT, which are based on Extended Kalman Filter and Maximum Likelihood Estimation, respectively. We adopt a holistic approach to introduce security awareness among state estimation algorithms without requiring specialized hardware, or cryptographic techniques. We apply SecSens to securely localize and time synchronize networked mobile devices.

In many ways, the Sustainable Development Goals reflect a profound shift towards a more holistic, system-wide approach. To inform responses to this shift, this article builds upon existing work on aggregate trends in donor financing, bringing together what have largely been disparate analyses of sector-wide and disease-specific financing approaches. Looking across the last 26\u2009years, the article examines how international donors have allocated development assistance for health (DAH) between these two approaches and how attempts to bridge them have fared in practice. Since 1990, DAH has overwhelmingly favoured disease-specific earmarks over health sector support, with the latter peaking in 1998. Attempts to integrate system strengthening elements into disease-specific funding mechanisms have varied by disease, and more integrated funding platforms have failed to gain traction. Health sector support largely remains an unfulfilled promise: proportionately low amounts (albeit absolute increases) which have been inconsistently allocated, and the overall approach inconsistently applied in practice. Thus, the expansive orientation of the Sustainable Development Goals runs counter to trends over the last several decades. Financing proposals and efforts to adapt global health institutions must acknowledge and account for the persistent challenges in the financing and implementation of integrated, cross-sector policies.

Method: Using serial BP data from the Fels Longitudinal Study, we examined secular trends in mean BP, the rate of change in BP with age (slopes), and the influence of obesity (i.e., BMI) and height on these trends during young-to-middle adulthood. The study sample consisted of 970 adults, aged 18\u201340 years, who were born between 1920 and 1979. Participants were grouped into birth decade cohorts and had up to 11 serial measurements of SBP, DBP, and BMI. Sex-stratified mixed longitudinal analyses were used to identify cohort effects on mean BP at ages 19, 29, and 39 years, and on the rate of change in BP with age. Results: For both sexes, mean SBP did not vary significantly by birth cohort, before and after adjusting for height and BMI. Mean DBP exhibited a U-shaped secular trend even after adjusting for BMI and height that was influenced by age-by-cohort effects. By age 39 years, those born most recently had the highest mean DBP. Conclusion: There were cohort effects on the rate of change in DBP with age, but not on rate of SBP change. The most recent cohorts had higher rates of DBP change with age compared to the earlier cohorts.

This is a typical Mediterranean lagoon, seriously affected by human activities since the 1930s, when it became one of the most important industrial sites in France. The overall range of concentrations is 38\u2013428 mg kg\u22121 for chromium, 50\u2013151 mg kg\u22121 for zinc, 11\u201348 mg kg\u22121 for copper, 18\u201382 mg kg\u22121 for lead, 18\u201356 mg kg\u22121 for nickel, 4\u201310 mg kg\u22121 for arsenic, 0.2\u20131.6 mg kg\u22121 for cadmium, and 0.15\u20130.40 mg kg\u22121 for mercury. The spatial distribution of concentrations largely mirrors the localization of major impact sources, with the most affected area restricted to a radius of a few kilometers from point sources, due to the environmental conditions of the outfall zone (fine sediments, low hydrodynamic regime, confinement), which favor the in situ accumulation of pollutants. The extent of contamination from trace metals in the lagoon sediments is evaluated through a three-pronged approach: (i) by comparison with other areas (see Table 3 for an up-to-date review of trace metal concentrations in lagoon systems and coastal regions of the world ocean); (ii) by evaluating the metal enrichment in the sediments through the calculation of concentration factors (CF) for each trace metal and by combining the CFs to estimate a Metal Pollution Index (MPI) taking into account the differences in toxicity of trace metals; and (iii) by defining a potential level of biological risk by the use of quality criteria such as the Threshold Effect Level (TEL) and Effects Range\u2013Low (ER-L) benchmarks. On the basis of the calculated CFs, sediments appear as particularly enriched with Pb and Cd throughout the lagoon and with Cr and Zn at some sites.

Critical micelle concentrations (cmc) of the amphiphilic monocaternary (\u03b1-hydroxyalkyl)phosphorus acid ammonium salts 1 and 2, determined by tensiometry and 31P NMR, showed a good correlation between the two methods and indicated their high surfactant properties. The phosphonate salts 2 with two dissociable groups had much higher cmc values than those of the corresponding phosphinate analogues 1. The ammonium salts of these phosphorus acids were able to form ordered lyotropic mesophases in concentrated water solutions, visualized by optical polarization microscopy. The nature of the observed mesophases (hexagonal or lamellar) depended on the concentration, the temperature, the nature of the polar head, and the length of the alkyl chain, the hexagonal phase being promoted for shorter chains (C8 and C10). The ability of these acids 1\u22122 to form stable and compact Langmuir monolayers at the air/water interface was studied.

They were video recorded for 1 hour within the clinic, practising their speech\u2010restructuring technique. The videos were then edited to remove all observable stuttering. Participants then viewed the resulting video of themselves using restructured stutter\u2010free speech each day for 1 month and were instructed to speak as they did on the video. Beyond\u2010clinic speech samples and self\u2010report severity data were collected before and after the intervention.Outcomes & Results: Very large effect sizes were found. The mean per cent syllables stuttered was 7.7 pre\u2010intervention and 2.3 post\u2010intervention. For all but one participant there was a reduction in stuttering from pre\u2010intervention to post\u2010intervention. These results were verified with self\u2010report data.

The study indicates video self\u2010modelling is potentially useful for managing relapse after speech\u2010restructuring treatment for stuttering, and in some cases may be a stand\u2010alone procedure to manage relapse.

Methods: We use conditional logistic regression models to estimate the statistical relationship between SES, sex and suicide. Results: SES, proxied by low income, unskilled blue-collar work, non-specific wage work and unemployment, increases suicide risk more prominently for men than for women. Marital status has a comparable influence on suicide risk in both sexes; parenthood is protective against suicide, and the effect is larger for women. Living in a large city raises suicide risk for women but reduces it for men; residents with a foreign citizenship in Denmark have a lower risk of suicide compared with Danish citizens, but this protection is confined to male immigrants.

Rapid warming has facilitated an increase in deciduous shrub cover in arctic tundra. Because shrubs create a cooler microclimate during the growing season, shrub cover could modulate the effects of global warming on the phenology and activity of ectotherms, including arthropods. This possibility was explored here using two dominant arthropod groups (flies and wolf spiders) in Alaskan tundra. 2. We monitored arthropods with pitfall traps over five summers at four sites that differed in shrub abundance, and used generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) to separate the two underlying components of pitfall trap catch: the seasonal trend in arthropod density and the effects of short\u2010term weather variation (air temperature, wind speed, rainfall, solar radiation) on arthropod activity. 3. We found that shrub cover significantly altered the seasonal trend in the abundance of flies by reducing early\u2010season pitfall catch, in line with observed later snowmelt in shrub\u2010dominated plots at these sites. 4. Additionally, shrub cover modulated the effects of many weather variables on arthropod activity: shrub cover shifted wolf spiders' temperature\u2013activity relationship, dampened the positive effect of solar radiation on the activity of arthropods in total, and ameliorated the negative effect of wind on the activity of flies. 5. Thus, these results indicate that shrub encroachment will probably be accompanied by altered arthropod responses to warming and other key weather variables.

Rates of detection were simulated for two different systems: the SPOSH (Smart Panoramic Optical Sensor Head) camera optimized for the observation of transient luminous events, and the JEM-EUSO (Japanese Experiment Module-Extreme Universe Space Observatory) experiment on the ISS (International Space Station). We conclude that up to 6 events per hour in the case of SPOSH, and up to 0.67 events in the case of JEM-EUSO may be detected. The optimal orbit for achieving such rates of detections depends on the mass index of the meteoroid populations. The determination of this parameter appears therefore critical before an optimal orbiting system might be designed for meteors monitoring.We programmed a simulator to assess how many meteors a dedicated satellite could detect.We linked the properties of a meteoroid with the luminosity of the produced meteor.We obtained a detection rate up to 6 events/h for a satellite using an existing camera.We can show the variation of detection rate depending on mission parameters.In comparison with existing ground-based camera networks for meteors monitoring, a space-based optical system would escape dependency on weather and atmospheric conditions and would offer a wide spatial coverage and an unrestricted and extinction-free spectral domain. The potential rates of meteor detections by such systems are evaluated in this paper as a function of observations parameters (optical system capabilities, orbital parameters) and considering a reasonable range of meteoroids properties (e.g., mass, velocity, composition) determining their luminosity.

Despite the large success of this technique for the edentulous maxilla and mandible with sufficient bone height, patients with atrophic jaws continue to be the challenging cases for an adequate reconstruction of aesthetics and functionality. Orthognathic surgical procedures have been developed to reposition the jaws and have been traditionally used in the dentate patient to correct a skeletal malocclusion; these procedures can be used on the edentulous patient to correct the discrepancies between the jaws followed by the placement of implants to rehabilitate the oral cavity. Recently, surgeons can use a computer-assisted software package that enables them to insert implants after a digital analysis of the residual alveolar and basal bone that makes for greater implant osseointegration. We describe a one-step oral rehabilitation with Le Fort I osteotomy and computer-guided implant placement to correct a posttraumatic deformity. Clinical Report: The first step of the definitive treatment, the implant placement, was planned with the aid of a computer-assisted surgery software package (NobelGuide; Nobel Biocare AB, Goteborg, Sweden). Ten computer-planned implants (Nobel Biocare AB) were inserted (6 on the maxillary arch and 2 on each posterior area of the mandible). Simultaneously, the patient underwent a Le Fort I osteotomy to correct the maxillary deficiency without any bone grafts. Discussion: The use of Le Fort I osteotomy as a preprosthetic procedure for the atrophic edentulous maxilla has been well accepted. This is a technically demanding procedure, and there are some described complications such as unfavorable fractures of the maxilla, oroantral fistulas, bone exposure, and low implant survival rates. However, in selected cases, this reconstructive method has the advantages over the other commonly used preprosthetic techniques of simultaneously allowing the placement of osseointegrated implants while correcting an unfavorable intermaxillary relationship and improving facial aesthetics. Computer-assisted surgery offers to the surgeons the possibility to visualize anatomic structures, evaluate implant position and inclination, insert accurately implants, prefabricate prosthesis, and avoid the morbidity of bone grafting procedures. Conclusions: One-step oral rehabilitation by Le Fort I and computer-guided implant placement can be used in selected patients. Despite the difficulty of this procedure, this approach enabled the authors to solve simultaneously a double problem: the malocclusion and the partially atrophic and edentulous jaws. According to the literature, this is the first case of a simultaneous Le Fort I osteotomy and computer-guided implant placement. The patient introduced had a posttraumatic deformity, but we think that this procedure could be extended in the future to manage other situations.", "title": "Simultaneous Le Fort I Osteotomy and Computer-Guided Implant Placement", "id": 619}, {"journal": "International Journal of Multiphase Flow", "authors": ["A.

A single laser sheet is used to excite the liquid film, which has been seeded with a fluorescent dye, along a longitudinal/vertical plane normal to the pipe wall. Two cameras, one for each technique, are placed at different angles to the plane of the laser sheet in order to recover, independently by the two techniques, the shape of the gas-liquid interface along this section. The effect of the angle between the laser sheet and the PLIF camera axis is also investigated. In film regions where the gas-liquid interface is smooth and flat, the conventional approach used for interpreting PLIF data is affected by total internal reflection of the fluorescent light at the free surface, or \u201cmirror effect\u201d, which leads to an overestimation of the film thickness that increases as the angle between the laser sheet and the camera axis is decreased. Nonetheless, local features such as light intensity maxima or minima are often located within the fluorescent signals that correctly identify the true interface, which in these conditions also coincides well with the BBLIF film-thickness measurement. When a correction for the mirror effect based on simple flat-film optical calculations is applied, this leads to PLIF results that correspond well to the true film thickness. Interestingly, it is further found that interfacial three-dimensionality, and in particular azimuthal/circumferential non-uniformity, can lead to underestimation of film thickness by PLIF that in some cases counteracts the overestimation due to the mirror effect. Smaller angles between the laser sheet and camera axis make PLIF less susceptible to this error. In regions where the film surface is rough, including on the surface of disturbance waves, the mirror effect is suppressed. The BBLIF measurement, on the other hand, is affected by loss of signal sensitivity or saturation in thick film regions, as well as distortions at complex or multiple interfaces in agitated flow regions with significant wave activity. Direct comparisons between PLIF and BBLIF measurement data confirm that local overestimations of the film thickness by the latter occur in film regions with higher interfacial curvature, especially at the front slopes of waves and around gas bubbles entrained in the liquid even in smooth films, while underestimations occur in regions with multiple interfaces and inside bubbles although it is often the case that features such as bubbles can be identified and corrected for in simple flows with smooth interfaces. Correction procedures are developed to compensate distortions caused by both methods that make these techniques more accurate for standalone employment. In highly complex, three-dimensional flows, the simultaneous application of both techniques is highly recommended to attain the most reliable information.", "title": "Simultaneous application of two laser-induced fluorescence approaches for film thickness measurements in annular gas-liquid flows", "id": 620}, {"journal": "ArXiv Physics", "authors": ["A.

Exact analytic results are possible in the case of ideal measurements of equal strength and are also shown to agree with solutions obtained using the Fokker-Planck equation. For a more general case with decoherence effects and inefficiency, we use a diagrammatic approach to find the correlators perturbatively in the quantum efficiency. We also calculate the state correlators for the quantum trajectories which are extracted from readout signals measured in a transmon qubit experiment, by means of the quantum Bayesian state update.

The most efficient polymer:fullerene devices comprising narrow optical gap donor polymers invariably have a high fullerene fraction. In such circumstances photo-generated carrier extraction is compromised, as charge transport is often unbalanced with electron transport in the fullerene dominating. In this current work we study the high efficiency blend system poly(2,5-{2-octyldodecyl}-3,6-diketopyrrolopyrrole-alt-5,5-{2\u2032,5\u2032-di[thien-2-yl]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene}) (DPP\u2013DTT):phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM). We show that by manipulating the packing of the (DPP\u2013DTT) chains, large hole mobilities >0.02 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 can be obtained in a simple polymer-only diode. More importantly, when blended with PC70BM in a 1\u2006:\u20063 ratio the hole mobility was found to increase to 0.2 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121. This is the first case of a polymer:fullerene solar cell where the charge carrier transport is limited by the electron mobility of the fullerene rather than the hole mobility of the donor material. Photophysical measurements reveal that the charge generation quantum yield is also enhanced when the DPP\u2013DTT chains are optimally packed.

Groundwater is the main source of domestic supply and irrigation in Korinthia prefecture, south-eastern Greece.

The definition of the most \u201csuitable\u201d site for the drilling of new boreholes is a major issue in this area. A method of allocating suitable locations has been developed based on multicriteria analysis and fuzzy logic. Twelve parameters were finally involved in the model, prearranged into three categories: borehole yield, groundwater quality, and economic and technical constraints. GIS was used to create a classification map of the research area, based on the suitability of each point for the placement of new borehole fields. The coastal part of the study area is completely unsuitable, whereas high values of suitability are recorded in the south-western part. The study demonstrated that the method of multicriteria analysis in combination with fuzzy logic is a useful tool for selecting the best sites for new borehole drilling on a regional scale.

Since the observed samples of SNRs are a collection of objects with very different ages and origin that evolve in different conditions of the ISM, statistical Monte Carlo methods can be used to model their statistical distributions. Based on very general assumptions on the evolution, we have modeled samples of SNRs at various initial and environmental conditions, which were then compared with observed collections of SNRs. In the evolution of SNRs the pressure of the ISM is taken into account, which determines their maximum sizes and lifetimes. When comparing the modeled and observed distributions, it is very important to have homogeneous observational data free from selection effects. We found that a recently published collection of SNRs in M\u200933 satisfies this requirement if we select the X-ray SNRs with hardness ratios in a limited range of values. An excellent agreement between distributions of this subset of SNRs and the subset of modeled SNRs was reached for a volume filling-factor of the warm phase of the ISM (partly ionized gas with nH ~ 0.2\u22120.5 cm-3; T ~ 8000\u221210 000 K) in M\u200933 of ~90%. The statistical distributions constructed in this way, which reproduce practically all the statistical properties of observed SNRs, allowed us to obtain one of the important parameters of M\u200933: the birthrate is one SNR every 140\u2212150 yr, and the total number of SNRs with a shock Mach number Ms \u2265 2 is larger than ~1000.", "title": "Size distribution of supernova remnants and the interstellar medium: the case of M\u200933", "id": 628}, {"journal": "Journal of Chromatography B", "authors": ["A.

A well-known approach to monitor sleep is polysomnography. However, it is costly and intrusive, which may disturb sleep. Consequently, polysomnography is not suitable for sleep behavior analysis. Other approaches are based on actigraphy and sleep diary. Although being a good source of information for sleep quality assessment, sleep diaries can be affected by cognitive bias related to subject\u2019s sleep perception, while actigraphy overestimates sleep periods and night-time disturbance compared to sleep diaries. Machine learning techniques can improve the objectivity and reliability of the observations. However, since signal morphology vary widely between people, conventional machine learning is complex to set up. In this regard, we present an adaptive, reliable, and innovative computational approach to provide per-night assessment of sleep behavior to the end-user. We exploit heartbeat rate and wrist acceleration data, gathered via smartwatch, in order to identify subject\u2019s sleep behavioral pattern. More specifically, heartbeat rate and wrist motion samples are processed via computational stigmergy, a bio-inspired scalar and temporal aggregation of samples. Stigmergy associates each sample to a digital pheromone deposit (mark) defined in a mono-dimensional space and characterized by evaporation over time. As a consequence, samples close in terms of time and intensity are aggregated into functional structures called trails. The stigmergic trails allow to compute the similarity between time series on different temporal scales, to support classification or clustering processes. The overall computing schema includes a parametric optimization for adapting the structural parameters to individual sleep dynamics. The outcome is a similarity between sleep nights of the same subject, to generate clusters of nights with different quality levels. Experimental results are shown for three real-world subjects. The resulting similarity is also compared with the dynamic time warping, a popular similarity measure for time series.", "title": "Sleep behavior assessment via smartwatch and stigmergic receptive fields", "id": 630}, {"journal": "ACS Chemical Biology", "authors": ["A.

Further problems arise because a number of factors are known to cause variation in the shape of schistosome eggs and it can be difficult to identify the African species, other than S. mansoni and S. rodhaini, on the basis of egg shape alone. An important problem in studying naturally infected snails is that there is no reliable method of distinguishing the cercariae of the different mammalian schistosomes. Progress has been made in studying populations of cercariae by the indirect method of exposing laboratory animals in the natural habitats and using the resulting infection rates and worm burdens as an assessment of the transmission potential of the habitat at the time of exposure.

Vineyards represent high-value cultivation in many countries; there is a tendency to adopt new and more intensive cultivation practices and/or to extend plantations to inappropriate sites, which influences the natural environment. Considerable damage thus increasingly affects vineyards in terms of partial or total destruction of cultivation, structures and infrastructures, as well as the surrounding landscape. However, little research has been conducted to date to investigate the role of grapevine plants on slope stability and to reduce the related impacts on the environment.Aiming to help fill the gap, we carried out a study to quantify the role of vineyards on slope stability by modelling the additional reinforcement to the soil provided by grapevine roots and their spatial distribution (i.e. considering the distance from the trunk) using the Root Bundle Model. A back analysis on a number of shallow landslides that occurred in vineyards was also conducted to validate the results. The area of our investigation was in the northeastern part of Oltrep\u00f2 Pavese, Northern Italy, which is a hilly terrain cultivated for many decades with vineyards and prone to landslide phenomena that in recent years have caused great economic losses to the agricultural sector and damage to buildings and roads. Moreover, abandoned vineyards represent an issue in terms of their \u201creturn\u201d to a natural stateValues simulated by modelling and back-calculated from the landslide inventory completely agree and are in the range of reinforcements commonly obtained for many other species. However, in contrast to native species, the spatial variability of the reinforcement in the case of vineyards is lower because of the regularity of planting and the lack of differences in plant age. Additionally, the variability of the rooting depth is negligible because it is controlled by the rootstock.Finally, the results obtained in this work show that the models developed for native species can also be adopted for grapevines and, if coupled with a slope stability model, represent a basis for providing guidelines to design vineyard plantations in those areas susceptible to instability, to support decisions concerning land management and land use change and more generally to reduce environmental impacts.", "title": "Soil reinforcement provided by the root system of grapevines: Quantification and spatial variability", "id": 644}, {"journal": "EMBO Journal", "authors": ["A.

Currently, the peatlands of this region act as habitat islands embedded mainly in a forest landscape matrix. This allows them to host more forest and generalist species of animals and plants than would be expected from such ecosystem. We were interested in testing if a taxon, unspecialized for such extreme habitats, can maintain stable populations in a peatland, and how environmental fluctuations affect its spatio-temporal distributions along a successional gradient. Terrestrial isopods were sampled in four habitat types: a fen, two successional habitats and a beech forest, with pitfall traps during two consecutive years. In total, 1069 individuals belonging to five species were recorded. Activity density increased more than four-fold along the successional gradient, from the fen to an older and more complex successional habitat. This pattern was governed by an increase in the structural complexity of the habitat, where succession habitats supported more favourable shelter sites for terrestrial isopods. Soil moisture decreased over 30% along the successional gradient. Additionally, the older successional habitat was more nutrient rich than the fen, providing higher substrate quality for decomposers and enabling the survival of forest species. The fen was inhabited by a single species, Ligidium germanicum, while other species were extremely rare. Its seasonal activity started in the spring, reaching the maximum in June and decreasing at the end of summer. Spatial changes in isopod assemblages along the successional gradient imply that the groundwater level in the fen was sufficiently high to supress the invasion of forest species into the fen.

However, endogenous proteinases such as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have active site similar to that of PLN, and there is a possibility that PLN inhibitors also inhibit the activity of MMPs, resulting in a loss of substrate degradation by these proteinases.

It has been shown that the mirror-image process of acceptor photoexcitation leading to hole transfer to the donor is also an efficient means to generate photocurrent (Channel II). The donor and acceptor components may have overlapping or distinct absorption characteristics. Hence, different excitation wavelengths may preferentially activate one channel or the other, or indeed both. As such, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the solar cell may likewise depend on the excitation wavelength. We show that several model high-efficiency organic solar cell blends, notably PCDTBT:PC70BM and PCPDTBT:PC60/70BM, exhibit flat IQEs across the visible spectrum, suggesting that charge generation is occurring either via a dominant single channel or via both channels but with comparable efficiencies. In contrast, blends of the narrow optical gap copolymer DPP-DTT with PC70BM show two distinct spectrally flat regions in their IQEs, consistent with the two channels operating at different efficiencies. The observed energy dependence of the IQE can be successfully modeled as two parallel photodiodes, each with its own energetics and exciton dynamics but both having the same extraction efficiency. Hence, an excitation-energy dependence of the IQE in this case can be explained as the interplay between two photocurrent-generating channels, without recourse to hot excitons or other exotic processes.", "title": "Spectral Dependence of the Internal Quantum Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells: Effect of Charge Generation Pathways", "id": 661}, {"journal": "Transition Metal Chemistry", "authors": ["A.

Owing to their inertia, particles are preferentially concentrated by the turbulence, and the resulting voids and clusters lead to deviations in mean transmission from the classical Beer-Lambert law for exponential extinction. Additionally, the transmission fluctuations can exceed those of Poissonian media by an order of magnitude, which implies a gross misprediction in transmission statistics if the correlations in particle positions are neglected. On the other hand, tracking millions of particles in a turbulence simulation can be prohibitively expensive. We propose stochastic processes as computationally inexpensive reduced order models for the instantaneous particle number density field and radiation transmission therein. Results from the stochastic processes are compared to Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) simulations using the particle positions obtained from the point-particle direct numerical simulation (DNS) of isotropic turbulence at a Taylor Reynolds number of 150. Accurate transmission statistics are predicted with respect to MCRT by matching the mean, variance, and correlation length of the DNS number density fields.

The numerical and analytical modelling of cover cracking due to the corrosion of concrete usually involves a delay in such corrosion as a consequence of accepting a propagation time, after the beginning of the process, in which rust products penetrate the porous network of the concrete and pressure is mitigated. However, the assessment of this delay is based on empirical data. Regarding such a time, there is limited published research that focuses on the initial stage of the propagation of rust products in the porous structure of the surrounding concrete.This work offers a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and strain gauges to study the phenomena involved at the beginning of corrosion. It focuses on the analysis of penetration of rust products into pores and measurement of strain and stresses caused in the concrete, near to the rebars, at the beginning of corrosion. It also involves use of an analytical model to calculate the width of the crack that could be used to estimate the time of cracking. The method has been applied to two concretes with a different porous network and with two distinct corrosion current densities to examine how the technique could monitor the reinforcement corrosion process and detect cracking of the surrounding concrete. The experimental work was performed by using an accelerated corrosion test on a conventional concrete (CC) and a concrete with silica fume (SFC) by submitting them, respectively, to a current density of 50\u202f\u03bcA/cm2 and 100\u202f\u03bcA/cm2. Part of the concrete specimens had embedded strain gauges, placed as closely as possible to the rebar, used to monitor the strain. The penetration of the rust layer was observed and measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). A good relationship between the velocity of the penetration of the rust products in the porous network and the delay of the cracking pressure in concrete was observed by introducing a reduction factor.", "title": "Study of the rust penetration and circumferential stresses in reinforced concrete at early stages of an accelerated corrosion test by means of combined SEM, EDS and strain gauges", "id": 699}, {"journal": "Physical Review D", "authors": ["A.

At this scale, the genome is partitioned into domains of different epigenetic states that are essential for regulating gene expression9,10,11. Here we investigate the 3D organization of chromatin in different epigenetic states using super-resolution imaging. We classified genomic domains in Drosophila cells into transcriptionally active, inactive or Polycomb-repressed states, and observed distinct chromatin organizations for each state. All three types of chromatin domains exhibit power-law scaling between their physical sizes in 3D and their domain lengths, but each type has a distinct scaling exponent. Polycomb-repressed domains show the densest packing and most intriguing chromatin folding behaviour, in which chromatin packing density increases with domain length. Distinct from the self-similar organization displayed by transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin, the Polycomb-repressed domains are characterized by a high degree of chromatin intermixing within the domain. Moreover, compared to inactive domains, Polycomb-repressed domains spatially exclude neighbouring active chromatin to a much stronger degree. Computational modelling and knockdown experiments suggest that reversible chromatin interactions mediated by Polycomb-group proteins play an important role in these unique packaging properties of the repressed chromatin.

At this scale, the genome is partitioned into domains of different epigenetic states that are essential for regulating gene expression9,10,11. Here we investigate the 3D organization of chromatin in different epigenetic states using super-resolution imaging. We classified genomic domains in Drosophila cells into transcriptionally active, inactive or Polycomb-repressed states, and observed distinct chromatin organizations for each state. All three types of chromatin domains exhibit power-law scaling between their physical sizes in 3D and their domain lengths, but each type has a distinct scaling exponent. Polycomb-repressed domains show the densest packing and most intriguing chromatin folding behaviour, in which chromatin packing density increases with domain length. Distinct from the self-similar organization displayed by transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin, the Polycomb-repressed domains are characterized by a high degree of chromatin intermixing within the domain. Moreover, compared to inactive domains, Polycomb-repressed domains spatially exclude neighbouring active chromatin to a much stronger degree. Computational modelling and knockdown experiments suggest that reversible chromatin interactions mediated by Polycomb-group proteins play an important role in these unique packaging properties of the repressed chromatin.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A surveillance program was installed to monitor risk profiles among new and repeat donors infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or human T\u2010lymphotropic virus (HTLV), or positive for the presence of syphilis antibodies. At posttest counseling, a physician interviewed donors to clarify possible sources of infection. RESULTS: A total of 167 repeat donors and 404 new donors were interviewed: 33 with HIV, 123 with HCV, 279 with HBV, 21 with HTLV, and 112 with syphilis antibodies. Most HBV, HCV, and HTLV infections were among new donors (80, 85, and 67%), whereas most HIV infections were among repeat donors (79%). Nearly 25\u2003percent of the donors did not report factors at screening that would have deferred them from donating blood. At posttest interviews, new donors with HCV often reported injecting drug use (19%). Repeat donors with HIV often reported male\u2010to\u2010male sex (8/26, 31%). CONCLUSION: A significant level of deferrable behavioral risks was found among donors with confirmed transfusion\u2010transmissible infections that persist despite current donor selection. Reporting such behavior at initial donor selection would have eliminated a substantial part of the infections found. This study argues against relaxing the existing donor deferral of persons practicing male\u2010to\u2010male sex, given their significant proportion of HIV infections among repeat donors.

We propose an event-trigger diffusion Kalman filter, specifying when to communicate relative measurements between nodes based on a local signal indicative of the network error performance. This holistic approach leads to an energy-aware state estimation algorithm, which we then apply to the distributed simultaneous localization and time synchronization problem.

We have analyzed the patterns of diversity and divergence of 13,400 genes in two human populations using an unbiased single-nucleotide polymorphism data set, a genome-wide approach, and a method that incorporates demography in neutrality tests. We identified an unbiased catalog of genes with signatures of long-term balancing selection, which includes immunity genes as well as genes encoding keratins and membrane channels; the catalog also shows enrichment in functional categories involved in cellular structure. Patterns are mostly concordant in the two populations, with a small fraction of genes showing population-specific signatures of selection.

Its spread has been rapid, particularly in disturbed wetland habitats, where it forms dense impermeable monospecific stands and modifies habitat conditions. The impact of A. fruticosa on native plant communities has been well analyzed, however knowledge concerning the possible effects on soil invertebrates and particularly carabid beetles is completely lacking. This study analyzed the impact of an A. fruticosa invasion on carabid beetles and other soil invertebrates. Soil fauna was sampled by pitfall traps at natural habitats, initially colonized by A. fruticosa, and habitats largely invaded by A. fruticosa. In total 2,613 carabid beetles belonging to 50 species and 72,166 soil invertebrates were collected. The invasion of A. fruticosa strongly affected the carabid beetle species composition, which clearly differed between all studied sites. Widespread euritopic carabid beetle species showed positive responses to A. fruticosa invasion, while the activity density of open habitat species strongly declined. Mean individual biomass was significantly higher at invaded sites due to increased incidence of large carabids (genus Carabus Linn\u00e9, 1758). Carabid beetle activity density and abundance of soil invertebrates were considerably higher at invaded sites than in natural sites. Conversely, the impact of A. fruticosa on carabid beetle species richness and diversity was less pronounced, most likely due to immigration from adjacent habitats. Changes in carabid beetle species composition and abundance of soil invertebrates were most likely due to changes in vegetation structure and microclimate. The results suggest that A. fruticosa invasion considerably affected carabid beetles, an insect group that is only indirectly related to plant composition. Therefore, severe future changes can be expected in invertebrate groups that are closely related to plant composition, since A. fruticosa cannot be completely removed from the habitat and covers relatively large areas.", "title": "Taxon specific response of carabids (Coleoptera, Carabidae) and other soil invertebrate taxa on invasive plant Amorpha fruticosa in wetlands", "id": 757}, {"journal": "Energy and Buildings", "authors": ["A.

Classically, this regulation includes genes encoding ER chaperones, ER-associated degradation factors, and others involved in secretory protein folding and processing, and is carried out by the transcriptional activators that are produced as a consequence of UPR activation. However, up to half of the mRNAs regulated by ER stress are downregulated rather than upregulated, and the mechanisms linking ER stress and UPR activation to mRNA suppression are poorly understood. To begin to address this issue, we used a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach to study the metabolic gene regulatory network controlled by the UPR in the liver, because ER stress in the liver leads to lipid accumulation, and fatty liver disease is the most common liver disease in the western world. qRT-PCR profiling of mouse liver mRNAs during ER stress revealed that suppression of the transcriptional regulators C/EBP\u03b1, PPAR\u03b1, and PGC-1\u03b1 preceded lipid accumulation, and was then followed by suppression of mRNAs encoding key enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein biogenesis and transport. Mice lacking the ER stress sensor ATF6\u03b1, which experience persistent ER stress and profound lipid accumulation during challenge, were then used as the basis for a functional genomics approach that allowed genes to be grouped into distinct expression profiles. This clustering predicted that ER stress would suppress the activity of the metabolic transcriptional regulator HNF4\u03b1\u2014a finding subsequently confirmed by chromatin immunopreciptation at the Cebpa and Pgc1a promoters. Our results establish a framework for hepatic gene regulation during ER stress and suggest that HNF4\u03b1 occupies the apex of that framework. They also provide a unique resource for the community to further explore the temporal regulation of gene expression during ER stress in vivo .", "title": "Temporal clustering of gene expression links the metabolic transcription factor HNF4\u03b1 to the ER stress-dependent gene regulatory network", "id": 762}, {"journal": "Gender in Management", "authors": ["A.

Cooling of the samples to the entry temperature for the last pass does not influence the texture of the sample, nor do higher cooling rates after austenitic finishing within the range of cooling rates in this study, although it may cause a refinement of the ferrite grains.

Our data indicate the existence, in both embryos and young birds, of a single class of statistically equivalent, high-affinity, saturable binding sites, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 80\u201390 nM in freeze-thawed/washed membranes, and about 8 nM in membranes additionally extracted with low concentrations of Triton X-100. Maximal densities of binding sites are nearly identical in both membrane preparations, ranging from \u223c2 to \u223c3 pmol/mg for the two age points considered.The pharmacological profiles suggest that avian receptors for [3H]muscimol are generally similar to the corresponding mammalian sites, behaving as typical bicuculline-sensitive, baclofen-insensitive type A GABA receptor sites. However, bicuculline and its derivatives are less efficient displacers of [3H]muscimol in detergent-extracted membrane preparations, being in all cases, as usually, much less effective displacers than GABA agonists.The effect of Triton X-100 on the muscimol site in the GABAA receptor, increasing the affinity for the radioligand by a factor of 10, and diminishing the efficiency of antagonists, is considered here in terms of structural changes in the receptor, induced by the action of the detergent on the membrane microenvironment.", "title": "The GABAA receptor complex in the developing chick optic tectum: characterization of [3H]muscimol binding sites", "id": 776}, {"journal": "Neurochemistry International", "authors": ["A.

The consonance among the rates of appearance and accumulation of the three receptor sites in tectal membranes suggests a coordinated expression and assembly of the protein subunits involved in the spatial configuration of the complex and its three binding sites, although the existence of isolated muscimol binding subunits during early embryogenesis cannot be excluded at the present time. Furthermore, the total number of binding sites of each kind, per pair of lobes, is compatible with a 1/1/I stoichiometry.

It provides empirical observation of Malaysian public\u2010listed companies based on the combined lens of stakeholder and legitimacy theory. Despite the comparatively low level of corporate sustainability disclosure in Malaysia, this content analysis of online sustainability information disclosure reveals that the companies with more diversified product lines disclose more sustainability information, and that the corporate sustainability effort is significantly related to brand name. Hence, companies should be encouraged to proactively improve their sustainability performance and disclose more sustainability information in order to strengthen their brand names.

This study examines the relationship between hospital surgical volume in cleft palate repair and outcomes. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the Kids' Inpatient Database was undertaken. Children 3 years or younger undergoing cleft palate repair in 2012 were identified. Hospital volume was categorized by cases per year as low volume (LV; 0\u201314), intermediate volume (IV; 15\u201346), or high volume (HV; 47\u201399); differences in complications, hospital costs, and length of stay (LOS) were determined by hospital volume. Results: Data for 2389 children were retrieved: 24.9% (n = 595) were LV, 50.1% (n = 1196) were IV, and 25.0% (n = 596) were HV. High-volume centers were more frequently located in the West (71.9%) compared with LV (19.9%) or IV (24.5%) centers ( P < 0.001 for hospital region). Median household income was more commonly highest quartile in HV centers compared with IV or LV centers (32.3% vs 21.7% vs 18.1%, P < 0.001). There was no difference in complications between different volume centers ( P = 0.74). Compared with HV centers, there was a significant decrease in mean costs for LV centers ($9682 vs $,378, P < 0.001) but no significant difference in cost for IV centers ($9260 vs $9682, P = 0.103). Both IV and LV centers had a significantly greater LOS when compared with HV centers (1.97 vs 2.10 vs 1.74, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Despite improvement in LOS in HV centers, we did not find a reduction in cost in HV centers.

Here we show that MIC-1 is often secreted in an unprocessed propeptide containing form. It is variably processed intracellularly, with unprocessed forms being secreted from several tumor lines, including prostate carcinoma lines, PC-3 and LNCaP. Once secreted, only unprocessed proMIC-1 binds ECM, demonstrating for the first time the occurrence of extracellular stores of MIC-1. The propeptide mediates this association via its COOH-terminal 89 amino acids. Xenograft models bearing tumors secreting various engineered forms of MIC-1 show that the propeptide regulates the balance between ECM stores and circulating serum levels of mature MIC-1 in vivo. The absence of propeptide results in \u223c20-fold increase in serum MIC-1 levels. The significance of stromal MIC-1 stores was evaluated in prostate cancer tissue cores, which show major variation in stromal levels of MIC-1. Stromal MIC-1 levels are linked to prostate cancer outcome following radical prostatectomy, with decreasing stromal levels providing an important independent predictor of disease relapse. In low-grade localized prostate cancer (Gleason sum score \u2264 6), the level of MIC-1 stromal stores was the best predictor of future relapse when compared with all other clinicopathologic variables.

Although the histology usually permits to highlight pathologic abnormalities of CIPO, it fails in almost a third of cases. The yield of a systematic immunohistochemistry needs to be evaluating. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one adult patients with idiopathic CIPO [11 females/10 males, median age 23.1 (0.3 to 57) y] were included and compared with 27 control and 10 with mechanical obstruction patients. Comparison between standard histology (hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections) and systematic immunohistochemistry using muscular (smooth muscle \u03b1-actin, desmin, and smoothelin-A/B), nervous (Hu C/D, Bcl-2, and S100 protein), and mesenchymal ( CD117 ) markers was carried out. Results: Histology showed neuromuscular abnormalities in 13 out of 21 (62%) patients, consisting of enteric visceral myopathy in 9 (43%) patients, enteric visceral neuropathy in 2 (9.5%), and mixed neuromyopathy in 2 (9.5%). Among the 8 patients who had no histologic structural abnormality, 6 patients (75%) had underlying abnormalities detected with immunohistochemistry: immunostain with Hu C/D detected a hypoganglionosis (<50 ganglion cells /cm) in 6 out of 21 (29%) patients, 4 of them undiagnosed on standard histology; CD117 (c-kit) detected a interstitial cells of Cajal defect in 10 out of 21 (48%) patients, 2 of them with no histologic structural abnormality. Smoothelin-A/B and desmin were useless as normally expressed in all patients with no myopathy; although it was not relevant in ileal samples (86% of abnormal expression in control patients), smooth muscle \u03b1-actin showed an abnormal expression in 2 CIPO patients (2/21).

We compare reported spending on a large number of categories of goods and services to comparable national income account data. We do this separately for the two components of the CE--the Interview Survey and the Diary Survey--rather than a combination that has been used in past comparisons. We find that most of the largest categories of consumption are measured well in the Interview Survey as the ratio to the national account data is close to one and has not declined appreciably over time. Several other large categories are reported at a low rate or have seen the ratio to the national accounts decline over time. The results are less encouraging for the Diary Survey. There is no large Diary category that is both measured well and reported at a higher rate than in the Interview Survey. We also compare the ownership of and the value of durables, such as homes and cars, in the CE to other sources. This evidence suggests the CE performs fairly well. Based on observable characteristics, the CE Survey appears to be fairly representative, although there is strong evidence of under-representation at the top of the income distribution and under-reporting of income and expenditures at the top. We then examine the precision of the two surveys and the frequency of no spending overall or for a given spending category. In the Diary Survey, we find much greater dispersion in spending and the dispersion relative to the Interview Survey varies across goods and over time. Diary respondents are much more likely to report zero spending for a consumption category, and a high and increasing fraction of respondents reporting zero for all categories. These results suggest that using Diary data to assess inequality trends and other distributional outcomes is likely to lead to biased and misleading results.

In this study, key umami taste fractions were separated and purified from thermally treated yeast extract (YE) to yield fifteen umami peptides. Systematic approaches using sensory-guided fractionation on taste-active umami proteolytics separation and detection were utilized. A reaction temperature of 110\u202f\u00b0C was optimum for umami peptide generation. Under this reaction temperature, the sensory score and E-tongue results of umami taste were the highest. The sensory evaluation-based taste dilution analysis and taste threshold determination supported the hypothesis that umami peptides have their physiological effect by binding to G-protein coupled receptors. The structural differences of umami peptides contribute to their taste profile and allow categorization into two group Types.

The tastes of Type I peptides could split into two stages: bitterness and umami in pure water, whereas, Type II peptides presented strong umami taste at a high concentration in pure water, and the relationship between umami capacity and peptides concentration was linear.

Aniline was found to be the only product formed through a reaction consuming six moles of thiophenol for each mol of aniline produced. The kinetics of the system have been analyzed in detail. In excess of thiophenol, all reactions follow first\u2010order kinetics (ln([PhNO2]/[PhNO2]0) = \u2212kappt) with the apparent rate constant kapp being a complex function of both initial nitrobenzene and thiophenol concentrations, as well as linearly dependent on the amount of solid catalyst used. A mechanism for this catalytic reaction consistent with the kinetic experiments as well as the observed properties of the intercalated molybdenum complex has thiophenol inducing the initial coupled proton\u2013electron transfer steps to form an intercalated MoIV species, which is oxidized back to the parent MoVI complex by nitrobenzene via a two\u2010electron oxygen atom transfer reaction that yields nitrosobenzene. This mechanism is widespread in enzymatic catalysis and in model chemical reactions. The intermediate nitrosobenzene thus formed is reduced directly by excess thiophenol to aniline. The values of rate coefficients indicate that reduction of nitrobenzene proceeds much faster than proton\u2010assisted oxidation of thiophenol. This may account for the observation that the presence of protonic amberlite IR\u2010120(H) increases considerably the rate of the overall reaction catalyzed. Activation parameters in excess of the protonic resin and PhSH were \u0394H\u2260 = 80 kJ mol\u22121 and \u0394S\u2260 = \u221270 J mol\u22121 K\u22121.

METHODS: Prevalence estimates of diabetes for the year 2000 were used to calculated direct and indirect costs of diabetes mellitus. Direct costs included costs due to drugs, hospitalizations, consultations and management of complications. The human capital approach was used to calculate indirect costs and included calculations of forgone earnings due to premature mortality and disability attributed to diabetes mellitus. Mortality and disability attributed to causes other than diabetes were subtracted from estimates to consider only the excess burden due to diabetes. A 3% discount rate was used to convert future earnings to current value. FINDINGS: The annual number of deaths in 2000 caused by diabetes mellitus was estimated at 339,035. This represented a loss of 757,096 discounted years of productive life among persons younger than 65 years (> billion US dollars). Permanent disability caused a loss of 12,699,087 years and over 50 billion US dollars, and temporary disability caused a loss of 136,701 years in the working population and over 763 million US dollars. Costs associated with insulin and oral medications were 4720 million US dollars, hospitalizations 1012 million US dollars, consultations 2508 million US dollars and care for complications 2,480 million US dollars. The total annual cost associated with diabetes was estimated as 65,216 million US dollars (direct 10,721 US dollars; indirect 54,496 US dollars).

This article proposes a framework that could accelerate progress in preventing these problems. Environments that foster successful development and prevent the development of psychological and behavioral problems are usefully characterized as nurturing environments. First, these environments minimize biologically and psychologically toxic events. Second, they teach, promote, and richly reinforce prosocial behavior, including self-regulatory behaviors and all of the skills needed to become productive adult members of society. Third, they monitor and limit opportunities for problem behavior. Fourth, they foster psychological flexibility\u2014the ability to be mindful of one's thoughts and feelings and to act in the service of one's values even when one's thoughts and feelings discourage taking valued action.

Emergency departments (EDs) are an ideal site for guidelines given the wide variety of presenting conditions and treating providers, and the need for timely decision making. We designed a programme for guideline development and implementation and evaluated its impact in an ED.Methods The setting was an urban paediatric ED with an annual volume of 60\u2005000. Common and/or high-risk conditions were identified for guideline development. Following implementation of the guidelines, their impact on effectiveness of care, patient outcomes, efficiency and equitability of care was assessed using a web-based provider survey and performance on identified metrics. Variation in clinical care between providers was assessed using funnel plots.Results Eleven (11) guidelines were developed and implemented. 3 years after the initiation of the programme, self-reported adherence to recommendations was high (95% for physicians and 89% for nurses). 97% of physicians and 92% of nurses stated that the programme improved the quality of care in the ED. For some guidelines, provider-to-provider care practice variation was reduced significantly. We found reduced disparity in imaging when assessing one guideline. There were also reductions in utilisation of diagnostic tests or therapies. As a balancing measure, the percentage of patients with any of the guideline conditions who returned to the ED within 72\u2005h of discharge did not change from before to after guideline initiation.

Instead, an examination of the heat budget in the flight medium indicates that, at about 1.6 bar (160 kPa), thermoregulation supply enters into equilibrium and, even at high ambient temperatures, overheating can be avoided and enough oxygen sourced.

Generalized linear modeling with gamma regression and a log-link function provided mean marginal hospital charge (MMHC) estimates associated with the presence or absence of patient, hospital and operative characteristics, postoperative complications, and length of stay (LOS). Results Overall, 70,695 women underwent mastectomy and reconstruction for unilateral breast cancer; 36,691 (51.9%) in the CPM group, incurring additional MMHCs of $20,775 compared to those in the UM group ( p < 0.001). In the CPM group, MMHCs were reduced in those aged >60 years ( p < 0.001), while African American or Hispanic origin increased MMHCs ( p < 0.001).

This connection varies with many factors including those specific to the aerosol type \u2013 such as composition, size, and hygroscopicity \u2013 and to the surrounding atmosphere, such as temperature, relative humidity (RH), and altitude, all of which can vary spatially and temporally. During the DISCOVER-AQ (Deriving Information on Surface conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality) project, extensive in situ atmospheric profiling in the Baltimore, MD\u2013Washington, D.C. region was performed during 14 flights in July 2011. Identical flight plans and profile locations throughout the project provide meaningful statistics for determining the variability in and correlations between aerosol loading, composition, optical properties, and meteorological conditions. Measured water-soluble aerosol mass was composed primarily of ammonium sulfate (campaign average of 32%) and organics (57%). A distinct difference in composition was observed, with high-loading days having a proportionally larger percentage of sulfate due to transport from the Ohio River Valley. This composition shift caused a change in the aerosol water-uptake potential (hygroscopicity) such that higher relative contributions of inorganics increased the bulk aerosol hygroscopicity. These days also tended to have higher relative humidity, causing an increase in the water content of the aerosol. Conversely, low-aerosol-loading days had lower sulfate and higher black carbon contributions, causing lower single-scattering albedos (SSAs). The average black carbon concentrations were 240ngm\u22123 in the lowest 1km, decreasing to 35ngm\u22123 in the free troposphere (above 3km). Routine airborne sampling over six locations was used to evaluate the relative contributions of aerosol loading, composition, and relative humidity (the amount of water available for uptake onto aerosols) to variability in mixed-layer aerosol extinction. Aerosol loading (dry extinction) was found to be the predominant source, accounting for 88% on average of the measured spatial variability in ambient extinction, with lesser contributions from variability in relative humidity (10%) and aerosol composition (1.3%). On average, changes in aerosol loading also caused 82% of the diurnal variability in ambient aerosol extinction. However on days with relative humidity above 60%, variability in RH was found to cause up to 62% of the spatial variability and 95% of the diurnal variability in ambient extinction. This work shows that extinction is driven to first order by aerosol mass loadings; however, humidity-driven hydration effects play an important secondary role. This motivates combined satellite\u2013modeling assimilation products that are able to capture these components of the aerosol optical depth (AOD)\u2013PM2.5 link. Conversely, aerosol hygroscopicity and SSA play a minor role in driving variations both spatially and throughout the day in aerosol extinction and therefore AOD. However, changes in aerosol hygroscopicity from day to day were large and could cause a bias of up to 27% if not accounted for. Thus it appears that a single daily measurement of aerosol hygroscopicity can be used for AOD-to-PM2.5 conversions over the study region (on the order of 1400km2).

Sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate derived from broccoli, is a potent inducer of endogenous cellular defenses regulated by transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), including cytoprotective enzymes and glutathione, which in turn act as efficient indirect and direct antioxidants that have long-lasting effects. Treatment with 6-thioguanine, a surrogate for azathioprine, leads to profound sensitization to oxidative stress and glutathione depletion upon exposure to UVA radiation, the damaging effects of which are primarily mediated by generation of reactive oxygen species. The degree of sensitization is greater for irradiation exposures spanning the absorption spectrum of 6-thioguanine, and is dependent on the length of treatment and the level of guanine substitution with 6-thioguanine, suggesting that the 6-thioguanine that is incorporated in genomic DNA is largely responsible for this sensitization. Sulforaphane provides protection against UVA, but not UVB, radiation without affecting the levels of 6-thioguanine incorporation into DNA. The protective effect is lost under conditions of Nrf2 deficiency, implying that it is due to induction of Nrf2-dependent cytoprotective proteins, and that this strategy could provide protection against any potentially photosensitizing drugs that generate electrophilic or reactive oxygen species. Thus, our findings support the development of Nrf2 activators as protectors against drug-mediated photooxidative stress and encourage future clinical trials in populations at high risk for cutaneous photodamage and photocarcinogenesis.", "title": "The indirect antioxidant sulforaphane protects against thiopurine-mediated photooxidative stress", "id": 830}, {"journal": "Environmental Technology", "authors": ["A.

The replication of our previously found effect of variation in the IL10 gene on IL-10 production and the correlation between repeated cytokine stimulation assays provide evidence that IL10 genetics have an important role in regulating the host response under high infectious pressure.Interleukin-10 (IL-10) production is under tight genetic control in populations living in affluent environments. However, little is known about the role of IL10 genetics on cytokine production in populations living in environments with high infectious pressure. We have previously reported that, in a rural Ghanaian population, the most common IL10 haplotype associates with a pro-inflammatory response. Here, we aim to replicate these findings in an independent sample of the same population 2 years later. IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) protein concentrations were determined in whole-blood samples ex vivo stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and zymosan in 2006 (n=615) and 2008 (n=647). The association between IL10 single nucleotide polymorphisms and Z-scores of IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 levels was analysed in each population subset. The most common IL10 haplotype was associated with a significantly lower IL-10 production and nonsignificantly increased TNF-\u03b1 levels. The correlation between repeated cytokine assays, based on 111 individuals with measurements in both 2006 and 2008, was r=0.53 (P&lt;0.001) for IL-10 and r=0.36 (P&lt;0.001) for TNF-\u03b1.

Results show that repeated retrieval consistently eliminated collaborative inhibition. This enabled participants to gain the most from re-exposure to materials recalled by their partners that they themselves did not recall and led to improvements in their individual memory following collaboration. This repeated retrieval advantage stemmed from the preferential manner in which this learning method strengthened retrieval organization. Findings are also discussed that reveal a relationship between retrieval organization and the interaction observed between learning method and short versus long delay seen in the testing effect literature.

This relationship was examined through the inclusion of two successive recall tests\u2014one immediately after learning method and one a week later. Results replicated the interaction in recall between learning method and delay characterizing the testing effect and, critically, revealed the qualitative differences inherent in the retrieval organization of each method.

We examined 335 type 2 diabetic patients (65.5 \u00b1 8.4 years) and 367 non-diabetic subjects (60.5 \u00b1 11.7 years). The results were validated in a validation sample consisting of 199 type 2 diabetic (66.2 \u00b1 8.5 years) and 224 non-diabetic subjects (61.2 \u00b1 12.7 years). In the study sample, the analysis of covariance, adjusted for the effects of age, gender and BMI, showed a significant genotype\u2013diabetes effect on insulin resistance evaluated by HOMA-IR (p = 0.038). This result was mediated by variations in fasting plasma insulin (p = 0.027), as no TP53 genotype\u2013diabetes effects were detected for fasting plasma glucose. In particular, in the diabetic subjects, Pro/Pro genotype was associated with lower values of HOMA-IR with respect to Arg/Arg (p = 0.013) and Arg/Pro (p = 0.006) carriers. No difference in HOMA-IR between diabetic and non-diabetic Pro/Pro carriers was found. Significant recessive model\u2013diabetes interaction effects on fasting insulin and HOMA-IR adjusted for age, sex and BMI were found (p = 0.007 and p = 0.029, respectively).

International travel and tourism are important modes for the acquisition and spread of antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, especially CTX-M-producing Escherichia coli. Infections with KPC-, VIM-, OXA-48- and NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae in developed countries have been associated with visiting and being hospitalized in endemic areas such as the USA, Greece and Israel for KPCs, Greece for VIMs, Turkey for OXA-48, and the Indian subcontinent for NDMs. To combat the spread of antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, the French Healthcare Safety Advisory Committee recently issued national recommendations for screening and contact isolation precautions for patients transferred from, or hospitalized outside, France. For effective public and patient health interventions, it is important to understand the role of international travel in the spread of antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. We urgently need well-designed studies to evaluate the transmission potential and risks for colonization and infections due to multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae in travellers who have recently visited or have been hospitalized in endemic areas.

Further validation is needed to confirm that these miRNAs target RAS mRNAs directly and that placental development is partly regulated by oxygen-sensitive miRNAs that target RAS mRNAs.

In this multicenter study, we analyzed the role of PTG and PTSS on the amount of time spent looking for online cancer information, its content, and its psychological impact. Methods Posttraumatic stress symptoms and PTG were assessed in 182 breast cancer survivors by using the Post\u2010traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist and Post\u2010traumatic Growth Inventory questionnaires. Subjects also completed a questionnaire about their behavior when looking for online illness\u2010related information (ie, time spent, type of contents, and psychological impact). Results Posttraumatic stress symptoms positively correlated with the amount of time spent looking for cancer\u2010related information, including both medical and psychosocial content.

The psychological impact of online information was associated with participants' levels of PTG and/or PTSS. Whereas PTG was related to a decrease of women's hope, PTSS was linked to the perception of being less conscious or inadequately informed about the illness, thereby increasing feelings of distress.

In most of the cases the model simulated drawbar pull as well as its variations due to changes in tyre pressure, wheel load, and soil strength reliably for practical purposes. Only when high wheel load was combined with low inflation pressure the model did not give suitable results due to an overestimation of the rolling radius. Based on the presented model, a convenient Excel-application called TASCV3.0 was developed for the practice.

By being sequence-specific, precise and efficient, transcription termination by pol III not only defines the 3\u2032 end of the nascent RNA which directs subsequent association with the stabilizing La protein, it also prevents transcription into downstream DNA and promotes efficient recycling. Each of the RNA polymerases appears to have evolved unique mechanisms to initiate the process of termination in response to different types of termination signals. However, in eukaryotes much less is known about the final stage of termination, destabilization of the elongation complex with release of the RNA and DNA from the polymerase active center. By comparison to pols I and II, pol III exhibits the most direct coupling of the initial and final stages of termination, both of which occur at a short oligo(dT) tract on the non-template strand (dA on the template) of the DNA. While pol III termination is autonomous involving the core subunits C2 and probably C1, it also involves subunits C11, C37 and C53, which act on the pol III catalytic center and exhibit homology to the pol II elongation factor TFIIS and TFIIF\u03b1/\u03b2 respectively. Here we compile knowledge of pol III termination and associate mutations that affect this process with structural elements of the polymerase that illustrate the importance of C53/37 both at its docking site on the pol III lobe and in the active center. The models suggest that some of these features may apply to the other eukaryotic pols.

These constitute a subset of promoter proximally paused genes for which mRNA elongation instead of promoter access is regulated. This difference can be described as a rearrangement of the regulatory topology to control the downstream transcriptional process of elongation rather than the upstream transcriptional initiation event. It has been shown experimentally that genes with the former mode of regulation tend to induce faster and more synchronously, and that promoter-proximal pausing is observed mainly in metazoans, in accord with a posited impact on synchrony. However, it has not been shown whether or not it is the change in the regulated step per se that is causal. We investigate this question by proposing and analyzing a continuous-time Markov chain model of PIC assembly regulated at one of two steps: initial polymerase association with DNA, or release from a paused, transcribing state. Our analysis demonstrates that, over a wide range of physical parameters, increased speed and synchrony are functional consequences of elongation control. Further, we make new predictions about the effect of elongation regulation on the consistent control of total transcript number between cells. We also identify which elements in the transcription induction pathway are most sensitive to molecular noise and thus possibly the most evolutionarily constrained. Our methods produce symbolic expressions for quantities of interest with reasonable computational effort and they can be used to explore the interplay between interaction topology and molecular noise in a broader class of biochemical networks.

To study the regulation of bilayer assembly in a cell cycle-independent manner, we have exploited the fact that phagocytes replenish membranes expended during particle engulfment in a rapid phase of lipid synthesis. In response to phagocytosis of latex beads, human embryonic kidney 293 cells synthesized cholesterol and phospholipids at amounts equivalent to the surface area of the internalized particles. Lipid synthesis was accompanied by increased transcription of several lipogenic proteins, including the low-density lipoprotein receptor, enzymes required for cholesterol synthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase), and fatty acid synthase. Phagocytosis triggered the proteolytic activation of two lipogenic transcription factors, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1a (SREBP-1a) and SREBP-2. Proteolysis of SREBPs coincided with the appearance of their transcriptionally active N termini in the nucleus and 3-fold activation of an SREBP-specific reporter gene. In previous studies with cultured cells, proteolytic activation of SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 has been observed in response to selective starvation of cells for cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids. However, under the current conditions, SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 are induced without lipid deprivation. SREBP activation is inhibited by high levels of the SREBP-interacting proteins Insig1 or the cytosolic domain of SREBP cleavage-activating protein. Upon overexpression of these proteins, phagocytosis-induced transcription and lipid synthesis were blocked. These results identify SREBPs as essential regulators of membrane biogenesis and provide a useful system for further studies on membrane homeostasis.", "title": "Transcriptional regulation of phagocytosis-induced membrane biogenesis by sterol regulatory element binding proteins", "id": 900}, {"journal": "Acta Pharmacologica Sinica", "authors": ["A.

Considering the various effects of its analogue NAD+ in the liver, however, effects of NADP+ can equally be expected. In the present work, this question was approached in the isolated perfused rat liver to get a preliminary picture of the action of extracellular NADP+ in this organ. NADP+ (100 \u03bcM) produced transient increases in the portal perfusion pressure. Glucose release (glycogenolysis) and lactate production from endogenous glycogen were transiently increased in antegrade and retrograde perfusion. Oxygen uptake was stimulated after a transient inhibition in antegrade perfusion, which was practically absent in retrograde perfusion. Pyruvate production was transiently inhibited. In the absence of Ca2+, all of these effects were no longer observed. Bromophenacyl bromide, an inhibitor of eicosanoid synthesis, almost abolished all effects. Suramin, a non-specific purinergic P2YX antagonist, also inhibited the action of NADP+. Single pass transformation of 75 \u03bcM NADP+ was equal to 92%. Besides nicotinamide, at least two additional transformation products were detected: 2\u2032-phospho-ADP-ribose and a non-identified component, the former being more important (67% of the transformed NADP+). Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) was not found in the outflowing perfusate.

The purpose of the present work was to determine the main products of extracellular NAD+ transformation under various conditions and to investigate the possible contribution of these products for the metabolic effects of the parent compound. The experiments were done with the isolated perfused rat liver. The NAD+ transformation was monitored by HPLC. Confirming previous findings, the single-pass transformation of 100 \u03bcM NAD+ ranged between 75% at 1.5 min after starting infusion to 95% at 8 min. The most important products of single-pass NAD+ transformation appearing in the outflowing perfusate were nicotinamide, ADP-ribose, uric acid, and inosine. The relative proportions of these products presented some variations with the time after initiation of NAD+ infusion and the perfusion conditions, but ADP-ribose was always more abundant than uric acid and inosine. Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADP-ribose) as well as adenosine were not detected in the outflowing perfusate. The metabolic effects of ADP-ribose were essentially those already described for NAD+. These effects were sensitive to suramin (P2XY purinergic receptor antagonist) and insensitive to 3,7-dimethyl-1-(2-propargyl)-xanthine (A2 purinergic receptor antagonist). Inosine, a known purinergic A3 agonist, was also active on metabolism, but uric acid and nicotinamide were inactive.

Reaction rates, monitored by UV\u2212vis stopped-flow spectrophotometry, were studied in THF/H2O media as a function of the concentration of phosphine, molybdenum complex, pH, and water concentration. The reaction exhibits pH-dependent phosphine saturation kinetics and is first-order in complex concentration. The water concentration strongly enhances the reaction rate, which is consistent with the formation of MoVI(S2C6H4)3(H2O) adduct as a crucial intermediate. The observed pH dependence of the reaction rate would arise from the distribution between acid and basic forms of this adduct. Apparently, the electrophilic attack by the phosphine at the oxygen requires the coordinated water to be in the unprotonated hydroxide form, MoVI(S2C6H4)3(HO)-. This is followed by the concerted abstraction of 2e-, H+ by the Mo(VI) center to give MoIV(S2C6H4)32-, H+, and the corresponding phosphine oxide. However, this Mo(IV) complex product is oxidized rapidly to MoV(S2C6H4)3- via comproportionation with unreacted MoVI(S2C6H4)3. The Mo(V) complex thus formed can be oxidized to the starting Mo(VI) complex upon admission of O2. Consequently, MoVI(S2C6H4)3 is a catalyst for the autoxidation of phosphines in the presence of water. Additionally, there was a detectable variation in the reactivity for a series of tertiary phosphines. The rate of Mo(VI) complex reduction increases as does the phosphine basicity: (p-CH3C6H4)3P > (C6H5)3P > (p-ClC6H4)3P. Oxygen isotope tracing confirms that water rather than dioxygen is the source of the oxygen atom which is transferred to the phosphine. Such reactivity parallels oxidase activity of xanthine enzyme with phosphine as oxygen atom acceptor and MoVI(S2C6H4)3 as electron acceptor.", "title": "Unusual Oxidation of Phosphines Employing Water as the Oxygen Atom Source and Tris(benzene-1,2-dithiolate)molybdenum(VI) as the Oxidant.

The research presented in this paper explores the feasibility of a swarm robotics system in an urban environment. By using bio-inspired foraging methods such as multi-place foraging and stigmergy-based navigation, a swarm of robots is able to improve the efficiency and autonomy of the urban waste management system in a realistic scenario. To achieve this, a diverse set of simulation experiments was conducted using real-world GIS data and implementing different garbage collection scenarios driven by robot swarms.

Over the last 20 years, salinity has risen in some existing wells and several new wells have encountered brackish water in areas thought to contain fresh water. A good linear correlation exists between the water resistivity and the chloride concentration of groundwater and shows that the salinity is the most important factor controlling resistivity. Two-dimensional electrical tomography (ET) integrated with geoelectrical soundings were employed to delineate different water-bearing formations and the configuration of the interface between them. The present hydrological system and the related brines and interfaces are controlled by the Dead Sea base level, presently at 410 m b.s.l. Resistivity measurements show a dominant trend of decreasing resistivity (thus increasing salinity) with depth and westward towards the Dead Sea. Accordingly, three zones with different resistivity values were detected, corresponding to three different water-bearing formations: (1) strata saturated with fresh to slightly brackish groundwater; (2) a transition zone of brine mixed with fresh to brackish groundwater; (3) a water-bearing formation containing Dead Sea brine. In addition, a low resistivity unit containing brine was detected above the 1955 Dead Sea base level, which was interpreted as having remained unflushed by infiltrating rain.

Photometric measurements were performed selecting four wavelengths (256, 280, 320 and 365 nm), using a diode-array detection system. The fluorimetric detection was achieved by measuring the sensitised luminescence provided by the chelates formed between each analyte and terbium (III). All samples were commercial wines bought in local markets and analysed immediately after they were opened. The pattern data matrix was constructed by the concentration of each analyte present in wine, which was determined by the most adequate method, namely LC-photometric or LC-fluorimetric method. This data matrix was subjected to different algorithms in order to classify and characterise the wine samples adequately. Supervised (LDA) and un-supervised (FA) pattern recognition methods were used. The wine pattern generation with LC separation and dual detection approach to determine eighteen phenolic compounds and the chemometric treatment provide an appropriate way with recognition and prediction rates. The values obtained for these rates were 100% when fluorimetric detection was used.

CPD depends on a rotamer library, an energy function, and an algorithm to search the sequence/conformation space. Variable neighborhood search (VNS) with cost function networks is a powerful framework that can provide tight upper bounds on the global minimum energy. We propose a new CPD heuristic based on VNS in which a subset of the solution space (a \u201cneighborhood\u201d) is explored, whose size is gradually increased with a dedicated probabilistic heuristic. The algorithm was tested on 99 protein designs with fixed backbones involving nine proteins from the SH2, SH3, and PDZ families. The number of mutating positions was 20, 30, or all of the amino acids, while the rest of the protein explored side-chain rotamers. VNS was more successful than Monte Carlo (MC), replica-exchange MC, and a heuristic steepest-descent energy minimization, providing solutions with equal or lower best energies in most cases. For complete protein redesign, it gave solutions that were 2.5 to 11.2 kcal/mol lower in energy than those obtained with the other approaches. VNS is implemented in the toulbar2 software.

This is difficult to verify empirically, and theoretical models are typically generic and not parameterized with data from real populations; studies integrating theoretical and empirical approaches to this problem are rare. 3. Here, we present experimental data on the growth of Scirpus maritimus, a clonal aquatic macrophyte that grows through vegetative extensions involving tubers. 4. The experiments show that offspring fitness (biomass productivity) is dependent on environmental conditions (water depth). 5. Experimental data indicate that variation in offspring (tuber) sizes can be approximated by a lognormal distribution. 6. We use these data to develop a different equation model of S. maritimus growth to test whether producing variably sized offspring is adaptive. The model compares fitness under the lognormal strategy to several hypothetical strategies with qualitatively different variance in offspring size. 7. The model results suggest that lognormal variation in S. maritimus tuber size may be adaptive to the temporal variation in water levels that characterize its natural Mediterranean environment. 8. We illustrate how the underlying principles that lend adaptive value to offspring size variation may apply to other species experiencing similar environmental conditions. 9. Synthesis.

The radial force was found not to be dependent on the radial direction, and the least radial force was found to be periodic with an angular displacement during the slow rotation of the PM relative to the HTS.

Methods and Materials: Effective doses were estimated from the dose area product values of 761 pediatric patients belonging to age groups 0, 1, 5 and 10 years old who underwent coarctation (COA) dilatation, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occlusion, pulmonary and diagnostic. The causes for high patient doses were investigated and the correlation of effective dose and DAP with patient weight, equivalent cylindrical diameter, fluoroscopy time and number of cine frames were analyzed. The maximum entance skin doses and effective doses were determined for 114 adult patients for cardiac catheterization and 320 adults for angiography procedures. Techniques to reduce patient entrance doses were investigated. Resuts: Pulmonary and PDA are high dose procedures with an average effective dose of 10 and 8.2 mSv respectively.

The peak of the age range, which is between 10\u201320 kyr, falls in an arid climate period. A comparison of the chemical composition of Omani chondrites with literature data for unweathered H and L chondrites demonstrates a strong enrichment in Sr and Ba, and depletion in S during weathering. Water contents in H chondrites increase with terrestrial age, whereas L chondrites show a rapid initial increase followed by nearly constant water content. Correlating Sr, Ba, and H2O with age indicates two absorption trends: i) an initial alteration within the first 20 kyr dominated by H2O uptake, mainly reflecting Fe\u2010Ni metal alteration, and ii) a second Ba\u2010and Sr\u2010dominated stage correlated with slower and less systematic weathering of troilite that starts after H2O reaches \u22122 wt%. Sulfur released from troilite partly combines with Ba and Sr to form sulfate minerals. Other parameters correlated with 14C age are degree of weathering, color of powdered meteorites, and the Ni/Fe ratio. Chemical analyses of 145 soils show a high degree of homogeneity over the entire interior Oman Desert, indicating large\u2010scale mixing by wind. Soil samples collected from beneath meteorite finds typically are enriched in Ni and Co, confirming mobilization from the meteorites. High Cr and Ni concentrations in reference soil samples, which decrease from NE to SW, are due to detrital material from ultramafic rocks of the Oman Mountains.", "title": "Weathering of meteorites from Oman: Correlation of chemical and mineralogical weathering proxies with 14C terrestrial ages and the influence of soil chemistry", "id": 973}, {"journal": "Journal of Scholarly Publishing", "authors": ["A.

The introduction of ICPs in healthcare organizations should provide better healthcare to patients and reduce unnecessary variations in practice. While there is a huge literature on definition, design and managing of an ICP, criteria to select the health problems are lacking. Therefore we aimed to define those prioritization criteria useful to define ICPs in healthcare organizations in Europe.MethodsA systematic review was performed in Pubmed, Scopus, CINHAL and Medline web search databases, using a Boolean search by the following mesh terms and free text word: clinical pathway, critical pathway, integrated care pathway, health priority, health problem, health issue and plan. The Delphi technique, as a structured process using a series of questionnaires to gather information, held until group consensus is reached, was applied to select and validate criteria useful for ICPs\u2019 health problems selection.ResultsBecause no articles, dealing with ICP prioritization criteria, were found, a second review was performed, focusing on priority setting of health interventions as a whole. 32 of the 327 articles resulting from the second review were included. Several criteria dealing with different dimensions (eg. feasibility, health distribution, health level, responsiveness, social and financial risk protection) were identified. Then, a Delphi panel, composed by European experts on ICPs implementation, was established. Preliminary results suggest that high priority should be assigned to health care problems characterized by a high need/demand volumes, wired evidences available, social and technological pressure, debate on literature.ConclusionsAgainst the growing interest in ICPs implementation as suitable tools to minimize delays and resource utilization and to maximize quality of care, no universal criteria useful to prioritize and plan ICPs implementation in healthcare organizations are available. Our framework, composed by dimensions, criteria and weights, should assist healthcare organizations\u2019 decision makers in planning activities and resource allocation.Key messagesSelection of health problems to be faced through ICPs implementation should be guided by several validated and shared criteria in order to ensure a better answer to health problems.Priority setting in a comprehensive ICP selection has policy implications on resources allocation, strategic planning and overall governance and management, with undoubted effects on equality, too.", "title": "Which criteria to prioritize the healthcare problems to be treated through the Integrated Care Pathways?: Antonio Giulio de Belvis", "id": 979}, {"journal": "American Journal of Community Psychology", "authors": ["A.

This analysis has guided the development of a network of social organizations that have been advocating for policies and programs that are reducing tobacco use. In contrast, there is not a widely shared, cogent, and empirically based analysis of the problem of violent crime. As a result, efforts to combat violent crime are fragmented and it has proven difficult to generate support for preventive programs and policies. Substantial empirical progress has been made, however, on how violent crime could be prevented. That evidence is reviewed. It is argued that the articulation of this evidence is a critical first step for achieving widespread reduction in the incidence of violent crime.

Drawing on 24 interviews with women who had a legal termination of pregnancy between 2008 and 2009, this research shows that legalization opens up new and complex relationships between women as subjects of rights and the state. Such relationships are expressed as three discursive figures: legal abortion (1) as a concession from the government, (2) as \u2018excessive\u2019 tolerance by the state, and (3) as a right to be protected and guaranteed. The analysis shows that women's interpretations of the right to legal abortion are mediated by profound transformations, which Mexican society is currently undergoing. These include changes related to a shift from a clientist political culture to one more framed in terms of citizenship, the subjective effects of family planning policies, and their ambivalent relationships with Catholic notions of women and motherhood, and the effects of feminist discourses of women's citizenship, abortion, and reproductive rights.", "title": "Women's interpretations of the right to legal abortion in Mexico City: citizenship, experience and clientelism", "id": 985}, {"journal": "Women's History Review", "authors": ["A.

The proposed method absorbs the magnetizing inductance and the leakage inductance into the inverter topology.

Mutations in any one of the plastid (chlL, chlN, and chlB) or nuclear (y-1 to y-10) genes required for this process result in the phenotype of the yellow-in-the-dark or y mutants. Analysis of the chlL, chlN, and chlB transcript levels in both light- and dark-grown wild-type and y mutant cells showed that the y mutations have no effect on the transcription of these plastid genes. Protein gel blot analysis showed that the CHLN and CHLB proteins are present in similar amounts in light- and dark-grown wild-type cells, whereas CHLL is present only in wild-type cells grown in the dark or at light intensities \u226415 \u03bcmol m\u20132 sec\u20131. Analysis of chlL transcript distribution on polysome profiles and rates of protein turnover in chloramphenicol-treated cells suggested that CHLL formation is most probably blocked at translation initiation or elongation. Furthermore, treatment of cells with metabolic inhibitors and uncouplers of photosynthetic electron transport showed that regulation of CHLL formation is linked to the physiologic status of the chloroplast. Similar to wild-type cells, y mutants contain nearly identical amounts of CHLN and CHLB when grown in either light or darkness. However, no CHLL is present in any of the y mutants except y-7, which contains an immunoreactive CHLL smaller than the expected size. Our findings indicate that CHLL translation is negatively photoregulated by the energy state or redox potential within the chloroplast in wild-type cells and that nuclear y genes are required for synthesis or accumulation of the CHLL protein.", "title": "yellow-in-the-dark Mutants of Chlamydomonas Lack the CHLL Subunit of Light-Independent Protochlorophyllide Reductase", "id": 997}, {"journal": "Cancer Research", "authors": ["A.

In squamous carcinomas, TP63 is commonly amplified, and \u0394Np63\u03b1 confers a potent survival advantage. Genome-wide occupancy studies show that \u0394Np63 promotes bidirectional target gene regulation by binding more than 5,000 sites throughout the genome; however, the subset of targets mediating discreet activities of TP63 remains unclear. We report that \u0394Np63\u03b1 activates bone morphogenic proteins (BMP) signaling by inducing the expression of BMP7. Immunohistochemical analysis indicates that hyperactivation of BMP signaling is common in human breast cancers, most notably in the basal molecular subtype, as well as in several mouse models of breast cancer. Suppression of BMP signaling in vitro with LDN193189, a small-molecule inhibitor of BMP type I receptor kinases, represses clonogenicity and diminishes the cancer stem cell\u2013enriched ALDH1+ population. Importantly, LDN193189 blocks reconstitution of mixed ALDH1+/ALDH1\u2212 cultures indicating that BMP signaling may govern aspects of cellular plasticity within tumor hierarchies. These results show that BMP signaling enables reversion of committed populations to a stem-like state, potentially supporting progression and maintenance of tumorigenesis. Treatment of a mouse model of breast cancer with LDN193189 caused reduced expression of markers associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, in vivo limiting dilution analysis assays revealed that LDN193189 treatment suppressed tumor-initiating capacity and increased tumor latency. These studies support a model in which \u0394Np63\u03b1-mediated activation of BMP signaling governs epithelial cell plasticity, EMT, and tumorigenicity during breast cancer initiation and progression.

Activation of hippocampal interneurons could directly inhibit pyramidal neuron activity but could also produce inhibition of other GABAergic cells leading to disinhibition of pyramidal cells. To characterize the inhibitory circuits activated by these receptors, exogenous acetylcholine was applied directly to CA1 interneurons in hippocampal slices, and the resulting postsynaptic responses were recorded from pyramidal neurons or interneurons. Inhibitory currents mediated by GABAA receptors were observed in 27/131 interneuron/pyramidal cell pairs, but no instances of disinhibition of spontaneous inhibitory events or GABAB receptor-mediated responses were observed. Two populations of bicuculline-sensitive GABAAreceptor-mediated currents could be distinguished based on their kinetics and amplitude. Anatomical reconstructions of the interneurons in a subset of connected pairs support the hypothesis that these two populations correspond to inhibitory synapses located either on the somata or dendrites of pyramidal cells. In 11 interneuron/interneuron cell pairs, one presynaptic neuron was observed that produced strong inhibitory currents in several nearby interneurons, suggesting that disinhibition of pyramidal neurons may also occur. All three types of inhibitory responses (somatic-pyramidal, dendritic-pyramidal, and interneuronal) were blocked by the \u03b17 receptor-selective antagonist methyllycaconitine. These data suggest activation of these functionally distinct circuits by \u03b17 receptors results in significant inhibition of both hippocampal pyramidal neurons as well as interneurons.", "title": "\u03b17 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors on GABAergic Interneurons Evoke Dendritic and Somatic Inhibition of Hippocampal Neurons", "id": 999}, {"journal": "Sexualities", "authors": ["A.

The mindfulness movement in particular has emerged as a popular expression of this contemplative turn. The vast majority of scholarly work on this subject rests on the assumption that mindfulness represents the culmination of the traditional trajectory of secularisation. Drawing on a discourse-analytic study of how contemporary mindfulness is constructed and made meaningful however, this article argues that these developments point towards a new modality of the secular. While the surface language of mindfulness operates in complete discursive isolation from the religious, its ontological foundation is nevertheless found to rest on a claim towards a transcendent whole. In the final analysis, this post secular hack of mindfulness signals a sacralisation of the secular with significant implications for the sociology of religion.L\u2019omnipr\u00e9sence actuelle de la m\u00e9ditation repr\u00e9sente le dernier r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019\u00ab\u2009orientalisation\u2009\u00bb de l\u2019Ouest.
