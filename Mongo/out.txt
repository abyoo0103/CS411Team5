Subjects with an ABI between 0.91 and 1.00 are considered “borderline” in terms of cardiovascular risk and further evaluation is appropriate. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of the oscilometric method to detect subclinical atherosclerosis in those subjects with mild decrease of ABI. Design and method: A cross sectional study was conducted among 328 hypertensive subjects (46.6% women). Patients underwent a ultrasonography study (Sonosite M-Turbo™. SonoCalc IMT®) to evaluate carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and oscillometric method (Microlife Watch BP Office ABI) to assess ankle-brachial index (ABI). Subjects were classified according to ABI ratio into four different groups: low (< 0.9); mild-low (0.9–0.99). normal (1–1.4) or over 1.4. Results: Low ABI was detected in 8.5%. mild-low ABI in 30 subjects (9.1%). 262 subjects were normal (79.8%) and only 8 were ABI > 1.4 (2.4%). We observed differences between groups according to waist circumference (105.2 Vs 101.6 Vs 101.4 Vs 99.5 cms, respectively). There were no differences between groups according to weight or BMI. When comparing those subjects with normal ABI and mild-low ABI we only found differences on DBP (85.14 Vs 81.53 mmHg) and pulse pressure (58.68 Vs 65.63 mmHg). Regarding IMT. mean values were 0.9 mms (ABI < 0.9); 0.87 mms (ABI 0.91- 0.99). 0.8 mms (normal ABI) and 0.73 mms (ABI > 1.4). Distribution of abnormal IMT values (> 0.9 mms) were detected in 47% Vs 44% Vs 23% Vs 0%, respectively. ABI correlated poorly and inversely with IMT (r: −0.136; CI 95%:0.02 – 2.28; p = 0.018). Conclusions: Even with mild-low ABI levels (between 0.9 and 0.99) double chance of detect subclinical atherosclerosis assessed by IMT estimation.

On the other hand, impaired nocturnal blood pressure decline associates to higher incidence on stroke, chronic kidney disease, and other cardiovascular diseases when compares to patients with normal dipper pattern. The aim of this study was to assess the five criteria distribution of MS according to circadian BP pattern. Design and method: A cross sectional study was conducted among 514 hypertensive subjects and MS (age: 53.3 years; 52,7% male. BP was measured by ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) every 20 min between 07:00 am and 23:00 pm and every 30 min at night, along 48 hours with a Spacelabs 90207 device. We analyzed 48h-systolic and 48h-dyastolic mean ambulatory blood pressure (48h-SBP and 48h-DBP), 48 h nocturnal systolic and diastolic blood pressure falling. Clinical and biological assessments were performed in all subjects. Results: The overall prevalence rates of circadian BP pattern were as follows: 9.7% riser; 34.4% no dipper, 48.4% with normal BP falling and only 7.4% with very dipper pattern. There were no significant differences between groups regarding systolic BP, weight or BMI but on waist circumference (103.4 Vs 100.4 Vs 98.6 Vs 101.2 cms, respectively). When analyzing different criteria of MS we only found differences when comparing diastolic BP (77.2 Vs 84.7 Vs 86.0 Vs 86.9 mmHg, respectively) or fasting glucose (121.9 Vs 111.6 Vs 107.1 Vs 113.8 mmHg). Neither fasting trygliceride nor HDL cholesterol showed differences. Waist circumference and fasting glucose poorly and inversely correlated with systolic blood pressure falling (r: -0.154; p = 0.001 and r: -0.151; p = 0.001) and dyastolic BP falling (r: -0.166; p = 0.000 and r: -0.198; p = 0.000).

Design and method: A cross sectional study was conducted among 404 subjects (55% women) with preserved renal function (MDRD > 60 ml/min. without proteinuria). BP was measured by ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) every 20 min between 07:00 am and 23:00 pm and every 30 min at night, along 48 hours with a Spacelabs 90207 device. We analyzed 48h-systolic and 48h-dyastolic mean ambulatory BP (48h-SBP/48h-DBP), 48 h nocturnal SBP/DBP falling. Clinical and biological assessments were performed in order to detect UA and kydney function. Results: The prevalence rates of UA between men were 55.1% (UA < 6 mg/dl) and 44.9% (UA > 6 mg/dL). Women had lower UA (83.8% < 6 mg/dL, compared to 16.2% > 6 mg/dL). Mean value of UA was 5.6 mg/dL among males (Vs 4.8 mg/dL among females; p: 0.000). We found gender differences on several clinical aspects between males and females as waist circumference (104.5 Vs 94.5 cms; p: 0.00), weight (88.2 Vs 73.3 kg; p: 0.00), 48 h SBP (129.8 Vs 126.6 mmHg; p: 0.05), diurnal SBP (134.4 Vs 131.3 mmHg; p: 0.01), nocturnal SBP (120.3 Vs 117.1 mmHg; p: 0.01) and nocturnal DBP (69.3 Vs 67.5 mmHg; p: 0.03). We only found differences in women (not in men) according to UA (lower Vs higher of 6 mg/dL) on SBP falling (11.1 Vs 8.0 mmHg) and DBP falling (16.4 Vs 13.4 mmHg). 58.6% of non dipper women presented UA over 6 mg/dL. UA correlated poorly and inversely with nocturnal SBP falling (r: -0.133; p = 0.039) and DBP falling (r: -0.163; p = 0.011). Conclusions: In a cohort of renal preserved function subjects. uric acid levels are higher in men and those with central obesity. No association between UA and office or ambulatory BP levels was observed independently of gender. Nevertheless, we observed inverse association between nocturnal BP falling and UA only in women. These results may help us to understand the underlying process of increased cardiovascular risk in women with high uric acid. Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.'}

BP was measured by ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) every 20 min between 07:00 am and 23:00 pm and every 30 min at night, along 48 hours with a Spacelabs 90207 device. We analyzed 48h-systolic and 48h-dyastolic mean ambulatory BP (48h-SBP/48h-DBP), 48 h nocturnal SBP/DBP falling. Clinical and biological assessments were performed in order to detect UA and kydney function. Results: The prevalence rates of UA between men were 55.1% (UA < 6 mg/dl) and 44.9% (UA > 6 mg/dL). Women had lower UA (83.8% < 6 mg/dL, compared to 16.2% > 6 mg/dL). Mean value of UA was 5.6 mg/dL among males (Vs 4.8 mg/dL among females; p: 0.000). We found gender differences on several clinical aspects between males and females as waist circumference (104.5 Vs 94.5 cms; p: 0.00), weight (88.2 Vs 73.3 kg; p: 0.00), 48 h SBP (129.8 Vs 126.6 mmHg; p: 0.05), diurnal SBP (134.4 Vs 131.3 mmHg; p: 0.01), nocturnal SBP (120.3 Vs 117.1 mmHg; p: 0.01) and nocturnal DBP (69.3 Vs 67.5 mmHg; p: 0.03). We only found differences in women (not in men) according to UA (lower Vs higher of 6 mg/dL) on SBP falling (11.1 Vs 8.0 mmHg) and DBP falling (16.4 Vs 13.4 mmHg). 58.6% of non dipper women presented UA over 6 mg/dL. UA correlated poorly and inversely with nocturnal SBP falling (r: -0.133; p = 0.039) and DBP falling (r: -0.163; p = 0.011). Conclusions: In a cohort of renal preserved function subjects. uric acid levels are higher in men and those with central obesity. No association between UA and office or ambulatory BP levels was observed independently of gender. Nevertheless, we observed inverse association between nocturnal BP falling and UA only in women. These results may help us to understand the underlying process of increased cardiovascular risk in women with high uric acid. Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.'}

Design and method: A cross sectional study was conducted among 404 subjects (55% women) with preserved renal function (MDRD > 60 ml/min. without proteinuria). BP was measured by ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) every 20 min between 07:00 am and 23:00 pm and every 30 min at night, along 48 hours with a Spacelabs 90207 device. We analyzed 48h-systolic and 48h-dyastolic mean ambulatory BP (48h-SBP/48h-DBP), 48 h nocturnal SBP/DBP falling. Clinical and biological assessments were performed in order to detect UA and kydney function. Results: The prevalence rates of UA between men were 55.1% (UA < 6 mg/dl) and 44.9% (UA > 6 mg/dL). Women had lower UA (83.8% < 6 mg/dL, compared to 16.2% > 6 mg/dL). Mean value of UA was 5.6 mg/dL among males (Vs 4.8 mg/dL among females; p: 0.000). We found gender differences on several clinical aspects between males and females as waist circumference (104.5 Vs 94.5 cms; p: 0.00), weight (88.2 Vs 73.3 kg; p: 0.00), 48 h SBP (129.8 Vs 126.6 mmHg; p: 0.05), diurnal SBP (134.4 Vs 131.3 mmHg; p: 0.01), nocturnal SBP (120.3 Vs 117.1 mmHg; p: 0.01) and nocturnal DBP (69.3 Vs 67.5 mmHg; p: 0.03). We only found differences in women (not in men) according to UA (lower Vs higher of 6 mg/dL) on SBP falling (11.1 Vs 8.0 mmHg) and DBP falling (16.4 Vs 13.4 mmHg). 58.6% of non dipper women presented UA over 6 mg/dL. UA correlated poorly and inversely with nocturnal SBP falling (r: -0.133; p = 0.039) and DBP falling (r: -0.163; p = 0.011). Conclusions: In a cohort of renal preserved function subjects. uric acid levels are higher in men and those with central obesity. No association between UA and office or ambulatory BP levels was observed independently of gender. Nevertheless, we observed inverse association between nocturnal BP falling and UA only in women. These results may help us to understand the underlying process of increased cardiovascular risk in women with high uric acid. Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.'}

The aim of this study was to assess the validity of the oscilometric method to detect subclinical atherosclerosis in those subjects with mild decrease of ABI. Design and method: A cross sectional study was conducted among 328 hypertensive subjects (46.6% women). Patients underwent a ultrasonography study (Sonosite M-Turbo™. SonoCalc IMT®) to evaluate carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and oscillometric method (Microlife Watch BP Office ABI) to assess ankle-brachial index (ABI). Subjects were classified according to ABI ratio into four different groups: low (< 0.9); mild-low (0.9–0.99). normal (1–1.4) or over 1.4. Results: Low ABI was detected in 8.5%. mild-low ABI in 30 subjects (9.1%). 262 subjects were normal (79.8%) and only 8 were ABI > 1.4 (2.4%). We observed differences between groups according to waist circumference (105.2 Vs 101.6 Vs 101.4 Vs 99.5 cms, respectively). There were no differences between groups according to weight or BMI. When comparing those subjects with normal ABI and mild-low ABI we only found differences on DBP (85.14 Vs 81.53 mmHg) and pulse pressure (58.68 Vs 65.63 mmHg). Regarding IMT. mean values were 0.9 mms (ABI < 0.9); 0.87 mms (ABI 0.91- 0.99). 0.8 mms (normal ABI) and 0.73 mms (ABI > 1.4).

Waist circumference and fasting glucose poorly and inversely correlated with systolic blood pressure falling (r: -0.154; p = 0.001 and r: -0.151; p = 0.001) and dyastolic BP falling (r: -0.166; p = 0.000 and r: -0.198; p = 0.000). Conclusions: In our cohort abnormal circadian BP pattern (“riser”, “non dipper” and “very dipper”) associate with higher waist circumference as well as higher fasting glucose levels These results may help us to understand the underlying process of increased cardiovascular risk in hypertensive subjects with impaired nocturnal BP falling.

BP was measured by ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) every 20 min between 07:00 am and 23:00 pm and every 30 min at night, along 48 hours with a Spacelabs 90207 device. We analyzed 48h-systolic and 48h-dyastolic mean ambulatory BP (48h-SBP/48h-DBP), 48 h nocturnal SBP/DBP falling. Clinical and biological assessments were performed in order to detect UA and kydney function. Results: The prevalence rates of UA between men were 55.1% (UA < 6 mg/dl) and 44.9% (UA > 6 mg/dL). Women had lower UA (83.8% < 6 mg/dL, compared to 16.2% > 6 mg/dL). Mean value of UA was 5.6 mg/dL among males (Vs 4.8 mg/dL among females; p: 0.000). We found gender differences on several clinical aspects between males and females as waist circumference (104.5 Vs 94.5 cms; p: 0.00), weight (88.2 Vs 73.3 kg; p: 0.00), 48 h SBP (129.8 Vs 126.6 mmHg; p: 0.05), diurnal SBP (134.4 Vs 131.3 mmHg; p: 0.01), nocturnal SBP (120.3 Vs 117.1 mmHg; p: 0.01) and nocturnal DBP (69.3 Vs 67.5 mmHg; p: 0.03). We only found differences in women (not in men) according to UA (lower Vs higher of 6 mg/dL) on SBP falling (11.1 Vs 8.0 mmHg) and DBP falling (16.4 Vs 13.4 mmHg). 58.6% of non dipper women presented UA over 6 mg/dL. UA correlated poorly and inversely with nocturnal SBP falling (r: -0.133; p = 0.039) and DBP falling (r: -0.163; p = 0.011). Conclusions: In a cohort of renal preserved function subjects. uric acid levels are higher in men and those with central obesity. No association between UA and office or ambulatory BP levels was observed independently of gender. Nevertheless, we observed inverse association between nocturnal BP falling and UA only in women. These results may help us to understand the underlying process of increased cardiovascular risk in women with high uric acid. Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.'}

Subjects were classified according to ABI ratio into four different groups: low (< 0.9); mild-low (0.9–0.99). normal (1–1.4) or over 1.4. Results: Low ABI was detected in 8.5%. mild-low ABI in 30 subjects (9.1%). 262 subjects were normal (79.8%) and only 8 were ABI > 1.4 (2.4%).

Results: The overall prevalence rates of circadian BP pattern were as follows: 9.7% riser; 34.4% no dipper, 48.4% with normal BP falling and only 7.4% with very dipper pattern. There were no significant differences between groups regarding systolic BP, weight or BMI but on waist circumference (103.4 Vs 100.4 Vs 98.6 Vs 101.2 cms, respectively). When analyzing different criteria of MS we only found differences when comparing diastolic BP (77.2 Vs 84.7 Vs 86.0 Vs 86.9 mmHg, respectively) or fasting glucose (121.9 Vs 111.6 Vs 107.1 Vs 113.8 mmHg). Neither fasting trygliceride nor HDL cholesterol showed differences. Waist circumference and fasting glucose poorly and inversely correlated with systolic blood pressure falling (r: -0.154; p = 0.001 and r: -0.151; p = 0.001) and dyastolic BP falling (r: -0.166; p = 0.000 and r: -0.198; p = 0.000). Conclusions: In our cohort abnormal circadian BP pattern (“riser”, “non dipper” and “very dipper”) associate with higher waist circumference as well as higher fasting glucose levels These results may help us to understand the underlying process of increased cardiovascular risk in hypertensive subjects with impaired nocturnal BP falling.

Design and method: A cross sectional study was conducted among 404 subjects (55% women) with preserved renal function (MDRD > 60 ml/min. without proteinuria). BP was measured by ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) every 20 min between 07:00 am and 23:00 pm and every 30 min at night, along 48 hours with a Spacelabs 90207 device. We analyzed 48h-systolic and 48h-dyastolic mean ambulatory BP (48h-SBP/48h-DBP), 48 h nocturnal SBP/DBP falling. Clinical and biological assessments were performed in order to detect UA and kydney function. Results: The prevalence rates of UA between men were 55.1% (UA < 6 mg/dl) and 44.9% (UA > 6 mg/dL). Women had lower UA (83.8% < 6 mg/dL, compared to 16.2% > 6 mg/dL). Mean value of UA was 5.6 mg/dL among males (Vs 4.8 mg/dL among females; p: 0.000). We found gender differences on several clinical aspects between males and females as waist circumference (104.5 Vs 94.5 cms; p: 0.00), weight (88.2 Vs 73.3 kg; p: 0.00), 48 h SBP (129.8 Vs 126.6 mmHg; p: 0.05), diurnal SBP (134.4 Vs 131.3 mmHg; p: 0.01), nocturnal SBP (120.3 Vs 117.1 mmHg; p: 0.01) and nocturnal DBP (69.3 Vs 67.5 mmHg; p: 0.03). We only found differences in women (not in men) according to UA (lower Vs higher of 6 mg/dL) on SBP falling (11.1 Vs 8.0 mmHg) and DBP falling (16.4 Vs 13.4 mmHg). 58.6% of non dipper women presented UA over 6 mg/dL. UA correlated poorly and inversely with nocturnal SBP falling (r: -0.133; p = 0.039) and DBP falling (r: -0.163; p = 0.011). Conclusions: In a cohort of renal preserved function subjects. uric acid levels are higher in men and those with central obesity. No association between UA and office or ambulatory BP levels was observed independently of gender. Nevertheless, we observed inverse association between nocturnal BP falling and UA only in women. These results may help us to understand the underlying process of increased cardiovascular risk in women with high uric acid. Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.'}

Subjects with an ABI between 0.91 and 1.00 are considered “borderline” in terms of cardiovascular risk and further evaluation is appropriate. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of the oscilometric method to detect subclinical atherosclerosis in those subjects with mild decrease of ABI. Design and method: A cross sectional study was conducted among 328 hypertensive subjects (46.6% women). Patients underwent a ultrasonography study (Sonosite M-Turbo™. SonoCalc IMT®) to evaluate carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and oscillometric method (Microlife Watch BP Office ABI) to assess ankle-brachial index (ABI). Subjects were classified according to ABI ratio into four different groups: low (< 0.9); mild-low (0.9–0.99). normal (1–1.4) or over 1.4. Results: Low ABI was detected in 8.5%. mild-low ABI in 30 subjects (9.1%). 262 subjects were normal (79.8%) and only 8 were ABI > 1.4 (2.4%). We observed differences between groups according to waist circumference (105.2 Vs 101.6 Vs 101.4 Vs 99.5 cms, respectively). There were no differences between groups according to weight or BMI. When comparing those subjects with normal ABI and mild-low ABI we only found differences on DBP (85.14 Vs 81.53 mmHg) and pulse pressure (58.68 Vs 65.63 mmHg). Regarding IMT. mean values were 0.9 mms (ABI < 0.9); 0.87 mms (ABI 0.91- 0.99). 0.8 mms (normal ABI) and 0.73 mms (ABI > 1.4). Distribution of abnormal IMT values (> 0.9 mms) were detected in 47% Vs 44% Vs 23% Vs 0%, respectively. ABI correlated poorly and inversely with IMT (r: −0.136; CI 95%:0.02 – 2.28; p = 0.018).

{'_id': ObjectId('5eadb62a0951bb9ad274a489'), 'abstract': 'Although much effort has recently been devoted to training high-quality sentence embeddings, we still have a poor understanding of what they are capturing. "Downstream" tasks, often based on sentence classification, are commonly used to evaluate the quality of sentence representations. The complexity of the tasks makes it however difficult to infer what kind of information is present in the representations. We introduce here 10 probing tasks designed to capture simple linguistic features of sentences, and we use them to study embeddings generated by three different encoders trained in eight distinct ways, uncovering intriguing properties of both encoders and training methods.'}
{'_id': ObjectId('5eadb62a0951bb9ad274a48a'), 'abstract': 'State-of-the-art methods for learning cross-lingual word embeddings have relied on bilingual dictionaries or parallel corpora. Recent studies showed that the need for parallel data supervision can be alleviated with character-level information. While these methods showed encouraging results, they are not on par with their supervised counterparts and are limited to pairs of languages sharing a common alphabet. In this work, we show that we can build a bilingual dictionary between two languages without using any parallel corpora, by aligning monolingual word embedding spaces in an unsupervised way. Without using any character information, our model even outperforms existing supervised methods on cross-lingual tasks for some language pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that our method works very well also for distant language pairs, like English-Russian or English-Chinese. We finally describe experiments on the English-Esperanto low-resource language pair, on which there only exists a limited amount of parallel data, to show the potential impact of our method in fully unsupervised machine translation. Our code, embeddings and dictionaries are publicly available.'}
{'_id': ObjectId('5eadb62a0951bb9ad274a48b'), 'abstract': 'State-of-the-art natural language processing systems rely on supervision in the form of annotated data to learn competent models. These models are generally trained on data in a single language (usually English), and cannot be directly used beyond that language. Since collecting data in every language is not realistic, there has been a growing interest in cross-lingual language understanding (XLU) and low-resource cross-language transfer. In this work, we construct an evaluation set for XLU by extending the development and test sets of the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus (MultiNLI) to 15 languages, including low-resource languages such as Swahili and Urdu. We hope that our dataset, dubbed XNLI, will catalyze research in cross-lingual sentence understanding by providing an informative standard evaluation task. In addition, we provide several baselines for multilingual sentence understanding, including two based on machine translation systems, and two that use parallel data to train aligned multilingual bag-of-words and LSTM encoders. We find that XNLI represents a practical and challenging evaluation suite, and that directly translating the test data yields the best performance among available baselines.'}
