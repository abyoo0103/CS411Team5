2,A Bayesian Model for the Prediction and Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease,A. Alexiou;V. Mantzavinos;N. Greig;M. Kamal,Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,"Alzheimer's disease treatment is still an open problem. The diversity of symptoms, the alterations in common pathophysiology, the existence of asymptomatic cases, the different types of sporadic and familial Alzheimer's and their relevance with other types of dementia and comorbidities, have already created a myth-fear against the leading disease of the twenty first century. Many failed latest clinical trials and novel medications have revealed the early diagnosis as the most critical treatment solution, even though scientists tested the amyloid hypothesis and few related drugs. Unfortunately, latest studies have indicated that the disease begins at the very young ages thus making it difficult to determine the right time of proper treatment. By taking into consideration all these multivariate aspects and unreliable factors against an appropriate treatment, we focused our research on a non-classic statistical evaluation of the most known and accepted Alzheimer's biomarkers. Therefore, in this paper, the code and few experimental results of a computational Bayesian tool have being reported, dedicated to the correlation and assessment of several Alzheimer's biomarkers to export a probabilistic medical prognostic process. This new statistical software is executable in the Bayesian software Winbugs, based on the latest Alzheimer's classification and the formulation of the known relative probabilities of the various biomarkers, correlated with Alzheimer's progression, through a set of discrete distributions. A user-friendly web page has been implemented for the supporting of medical doctors and researchers, to upload Alzheimer's tests and receive statistics on the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease development or presence, due to abnormal testing in one or more biomarkers."
3,A Randomized Trial Comparing Renal Function in Older Kidney Transplant Patients Following Delayed Versus Immediate Tacrolimus Administration,A. Andrés;K. Budde;P. Clavien;T. Becker;M. Kessler;P. Pisarski;P. Fornara;D. Burmeister;R. Hené;E. Cassuto-Viguier,Transplantation,"Background.: This large, randomized, multicenter trial evaluated if basiliximab induction and delayed tacrolimus can preserve renal function in older kidney transplant patients. Methods.: Patients aged 60 years and older received delayed tacrolimus with basiliximab and mycophenolate mofetil with early steroid discontinuation (Tac-d, n=132) or standard tacrolimus with mycophenolate mofetil and steroids until day 91 (Tac-s, n=122). Tacrolimus trough levels were 5 to 10 ng/mL after day 43 in both groups. Renal function at month 6 was measured by calculated creatinine clearance (Cockcroft-Gault formula). Results.: In both groups, mean recipient age was 66 years, mean donor age was 63 years with 73% of donors aged 60 years and older. Steroid discontinuation was slower than protocol specified. In the Tac-d group, 56.1% were steroid free at day 14 and 81.8% at month 6. In the Tac-s group, 37.7% were steroid free at month 4 and 63.9% at month 6. Mean (±SD) calculated creatinine clearance was 45.7±16.1 mL/min (Tac-d) and 45.0±18.2 mL/min (Tac-s) ( P =ns), mean glomerular filtration rate (modified diet in renal disease formula) was 44.9±16.2 mL/min and 41.6±16.8 mL/min, respectively. Incidences of biopsy-proven acute rejection were 18.9% (Tac-d) and 18.0% (Tac-s). Delayed graft function was 30.3% (Tac-d) and 23.8% (Tac-s). Estimated patient survival rates (Kaplan-Meier) in the Tac-d and Tac-s groups were 96.1% vs. 99.2% and estimated graft survival rates were 90% vs. 87.6%, respectively. Safety results were similar with both regimens. Conclusion.: Delayed tacrolimus with basiliximab induction did not provide an advantage in preserving renal function or reducing delayed graft function in older kidney transplant patients."
4,A SON-Based Algorithm for the Optimization of Inter-RAT Handover Parameters,A. Awada;B. Wegmann;I. Viering;A. Klein,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,"First, the deployment of the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) system will be concentrated on areas with high user traffic overlaying with the legacy second-generation (2G) or third-generation (3G) mobile system. Consequently, the limited LTE coverage will result in many inter-radio access technology (RAT) handovers from LTE to 3G systems and vice versa. Trouble-free operation of inter-RAT handovers requires the optimization of the handover parameters of each cell in both RATs. The current network planning and optimization methods provide a fixed network-wide setting for all the handover parameters of the cells. Cells that later show considerable mobility problems in operation mode are manually optimized with the aid of drive tests and expert knowledge. This manual optimization of the handover parameters requires permanent human intervention and increases the operational expenditure (OPEX) of the mobile operators. Moreover, the interoperability of several RATs increases further the parameter space of the handover parameters, which makes the manual optimization difficult and almost impracticable. To reduce OPEX and to achieve a better network performance, we propose in this paper a self-optimizing algorithm where each cell in a RAT updates its handover parameters in an autonomous and automated manner depending on its traffic and mobility conditions. The proposed algorithm uses a feedback controller to update the handover parameters as a means to providing a steady improvement in the network performance. In the context of control theory, the feedback controller consists of a proportional control block, which regulates the change in the magnitude of each handover parameter, and a gain scheduler, which modifies the parameters of the proportional control block depending on the mobility conditions in each cell. To benchmark the design of the proposed algorithm, we apply two general and nonself-optimization algorithms: Taguchi's method and simulated annealing to optimize the handover parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed self-optimizing algorithm reaches a stable optimized operation point with cell-specific handover parameter settings, which considerably reduce the number of mobility failure events in the network, compared with three fixed settings for the handover parameters. Moreover, it is presented that the proposed self-optimizing algorithm outperforms Taguchi's method and simulated annealing when applied to a mobility robustness optimization (MRO) problem."
5,A comparative study of particle swarm optimization and its variants for phase stability and equilibrium calculations in multicomponent reactive and non-reactive systems,A. Bonilla-Petriciolet;J. Segovia-Hernández,Fluid Phase Equilibria,"Particle swarm optimization is a novel evolutionary stochastic global optimization method that has gained popularity in the chemical engineering community. This optimization strategy has been successfully used for several applications including thermodynamic calculations. To the best of our knowledge, the performance of PSO in phase stability and equilibrium calculations for both multicomponent reactive and non-reactive mixtures has not yet been reported. This study introduces the application of particle swarm optimization and several of its variants for solving phase stability and equilibrium problems in multicomponent systems with or without chemical equilibrium. The reliability and efficiency of a number of particle swarm optimization algorithms are tested and compared using multicomponent systems with vapor–liquid and liquid–liquid equilibrium. Our results indicate that the classical particle swarm optimization with constant cognitive and social parameters is a reliable method and offers the best performance for global minimization of the tangent plane distance function and the Gibbs energy function in both reactive and non-reactive systems.Particle swarm optimization is a novel evolutionary stochastic global optimization method that has gained popularity in the chemical engineering community.

6,A comparison between different methods for determining grain distribution in coarse channel beds,A. Cislaghi;E. Chiaradia;G. Bischetti,International Journal of Sediment Research,"The determination of grain size distribution in alluvial channels plays a crucial role in understanding fluvial dynamics and processes (e.g., hydraulic resistance, sediment transport and erosion, and habitat suitability). However, to determine an accurate distribution, tremendous field efforts are often required. Traditionally, the grain size distribution of channel beds have been obtained by manually counting a set of randomly selected stones (the “pebble count”). Based on this elementary principle, many authors have proposed different adaptations to overcome weaknesses and problems with the original method; with the development of digital technology, photographic methods have been developed in order to significantly reduce the time spent in the field. Two of these “image-assisted” methods include Automated Grain Sizing, AGS, and Manual Photo Sieving, MPS. In this study, AGS and MPS were applied under ideal laboratory conditions, to be used as reference, and in two field conditions with different degrees of difficulty in terms of visual determination of the grain size distribution; these included an artificial unlined channel and two natural mountainous streams. The results were compared with those obtained with the pebble-count method. In general, strong agreement between the methods was found when they were applied under favorable conditions (”the laboratory”), and the differences between the image-assisted and pebble count methods were similar to those found in previous studies. Despite being more time consuming, MPS was deemed preferable to AGS when conditions are not optimal; in these cases, the time spent on image elaboration significantly increased in the AGS method (approximately three-fold), but the estimation error of the median grain size decreased by approximately 37%. The use of image-assisted analysis has proven to be robust for characterizing sediment in watercourse beds and reducing fieldwork time, but because field conditions can significantly affect the accuracy of results, the method choice must be carefully considered."
7,A five-year longitudinal study of the validity of creativity tests.,A. Cropley,Developmental Psychology,"Administered the Seeing Problems, Consequences, Symbol Production, Hidden Figures, and E. Torrance's Tin Can Uses and Circles tests to 7th graders in June 1964. In April 1969 111 Ss were relocated. Data concerning their out of school achievement in art, drama, literature, and music were collected. When the 6 creativity tests were combined to form a single composite creativity predictor, and correlated with the 4 achievements tests, combined to form a single criterion of creative behavior in nonacademic life, the resulting canonical correlations were .52 for boys, .46 for girls, and .51 for the full sample. Results indicate that creativity tests can be said to possess reasonable and encouraging long-range predictive validity. (19 ref.)"
8,A framework for dynamic classifier selection oriented by the classification problem difficulty,A. Brun;A. Britto;L. Oliveira;F. Enembreck;R. Sabourin,Pattern Recognition,"This paper describes a framework for Dynamic Classifier Selection (DCS) whose novelty resides in its use of features that address the difficulty posed by the classification problem in terms of orienting both pool generation and classifier selection. The classification difficulty is described by meta-features estimated from problem data using complexity measures. Firstly, these features are used to drive the classifier pool generation expecting a better coverage of the problem space, and then, a dynamic classifier selection based on similar features estimates the ability of the classifiers to deal with the test instance. The rationale here is to dynamically select a classifier trained on a subproblem (training subset) having a similar level of difficulty as that observed in the neighborhood of the test instance defined in a validation set. A robust experimental protocol based on 30 datasets, and considering 20 replications, has confirmed that a better understanding of the classification problem difficulty may positively impact the performance of a DCS. For the pool generation method, it was observed that in 126 of 180 experiments (70.0%) adopting the proposed pool generator allowed an improvement of the accuracy of the evaluated DCS methods. In addition, the main results from the proposed framework, in which pool generation and classifier selection are both based on problem difficulty features, are very promising. In 165 of 180 experiments (91.6%), it was also observed that the proposed DCS framework based on the problem difficulty achieved a better classification accuracy when compared to 6 well known DCS methods in the literature.Framework for dynamic classifier selection oriented by the classification difficulty.Pool generation considering a better coverage of the problem complexity space.Classifier selection based on meta-features related to the problem complexity.This paper describes a framework for Dynamic Classifier Selection (DCS) whose novelty resides in its use of features that address the difficulty posed by the classification problem in terms of orienting both pool generation and classifier selection.

9,A meta-analytic review of the effect of implementation intentions on physical activity,A. Bélanger-Gravel;G. Godin;S. Amireault,Health Psychology Review,"Implementation intentions are a powerful strategy to promote health-related behaviours, but mixed results are observed regarding physical activity. The primary aim of this study was to systematically and quantitatively review the literature on the effectiveness of implementation intentions on physical activity. The second aim was to identify conditions under which effectiveness is optimal. A literature search was performed in several databases for published and non-published reports. The inverse variance method with random effect model was used for the meta-analysis of results. Effect sizes were reported as standard mean differences. Twenty-six independent studies were included in the systematic review. The overall effect size of implementation intentions was 0.31, 95% confidence intervals (CI) [0.11, 0.51] at post-intervention and 0.24, 95% CI [0.13, 0.35] at follow-up. The duration of follow-up had no significant effect on effect size (F(1, 18) = 0.21, p=0.66. This strategy was more effective among student and clinical samples, and when barrier management was part of implementation intentions. The present meta-analysis provides support for the use of implementation intentions to promote physical activity, even though the effect size is small to medium."
10,A method for aquifer identification in petroleum reservoirs: A case study of Puerto Ceiba oilfield,A. Cosultchi;L. Sheremetov;J. Velasco-Hernandez;I. Batyrshin,Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering,"The paper describes an efficient multi-stage data-driven method for aquifer and water influx pattern classification. It is based on statistical multivariate analysis techniques, Principal Components Analysis and Cluster Analysis. The main advantage of the proposed method is the integration of the analysis of static (water and oil properties) and dynamic (production series) data in order to understand the water-related behavior of the oilfield. For oilfield aquifers classification, oil and water physicochemical properties are used. Water influx pattern classification consists of three steps. Firstly, single-well production data analysis techniques are applied: (1) conventional decline curve analysis; and (2) a novel water-cut curve analysis with a logistic growth equation. Secondly, the obtained parameters are employed for the statistical multivariate analysis of the field. Finally, logistic-type equation parameters are used for qualitative identification of velocity of water entrance, water amount and first date of water entrance. The proposed method is discussed and illustrated using Puerto Ceiba case study. The work is a step forward towards the introduction of data-driven approaches in the engineering practices of water control."
11,A multi‐MHz single‐shot data acquisition scheme with high dynamic range: pump–probe X‐ray experiments at synchrotrons,A. Britz;T. Assefa;A. Galler;W. Gawelda;M. Diez;P. Zalden;D. Khakhulin;B. Fernandes;P. Gessler;H. Namin;A. Beckmann;M. Harder;H. Yavaş;C. Bressler,Journal of Synchrotron Radiation,"The technical implementation of a multi‐MHz data acquisition scheme for laser–X‐ray pump–probe experiments with pulse limited temporal resolution (100 ps) is presented. Such techniques are very attractive to benefit from the high‐repetition rates of X‐ray pulses delivered from advanced synchrotron radiation sources. Exploiting a synchronized 3.9 MHz laser excitation source, experiments in 60‐bunch mode (7.8 MHz) at beamline P01 of the PETRA III storage ring are performed. Hereby molecular systems in liquid solutions are excited by the pulsed laser source and the total X‐ray fluorescence yield (TFY) from the sample is recorded using silicon avalanche photodiode detectors (APDs). The subsequent digitizer card samples the APD signal traces in 0.5 ns steps with 12‐bit resolution. These traces are then processed to deliver an integrated value for each recorded single X‐ray pulse intensity and sorted into bins according to whether the laser excited the sample or not. For each subgroup the recorded single‐shot values are averaged over ∼107 pulses to deliver a mean TFY value with its standard error for each data point, e.g. at a given X‐ray probe energy. The sensitivity reaches down to the shot‐noise limit, and signal‐to‐noise ratios approaching 1000 are achievable in only a few seconds collection time per data point. The dynamic range covers 100 photons pulse−1 and is only technically limited by the utilized APD."
12,A new set of correlations for EHD enhanced condensation heat transfer of tubular systems,A. Al-Ahmadi;R. Al-Dadah,Applied Thermal Engineering,"An improved set of correlations for evaluating the heat transfer coefficient of EHD assisted condensation heat transfer for tubular systems is presented in this paper. The correlations were developed by curve fitting a wide range of experimental data and then optimising the empirical constants so that the percentage deviation is less than ±30%. The experimental data was classified in four categories: (I) condensation outside horizontal smooth tubes, (II) condensation inside horizontal smooth tubes, (III) condensation outside vertical tubes and (IV) condensation inside vertical tubes. The experimental data in each category included results obtained using various refrigerants and various electrode systems. The improved correlations were used to predict a total of 166 experimental data points.A comprehensive literature review of all available correlations for EHD assisted condensation heat transfer is also described in this paper. Two correlations that were identified to be simple were used to predict the above-mentioned data bank. These are the correlations of Choi and Reynolds and Didkovesky and Bologa. The Choi and Reynolds correlation was found to successfully predict heat transfer rates of condensation outside horizontal and vertical tubes and of condensation inside vertical tubes when high intensity electric field is applied. However, the Didkovesky and Bologa correlation was found to successfully predict only the results of condensation heat transfer outside vertical surfaces."
13,A probabilistic multidimensional approach to quantify large wood recruitment from hillslopes in mountainous-forested catchments,A. Cislaghi;E. Rigon;M. Lenzi;G. Bischetti,Geomorphology,"Large wood (LW) plays a key role in physical, chemical, environmental, and biological processes in most natural and seminatural streams. However, it is also a source of hydraulic hazard in anthropised territories. Recruitment from fluvial processes has been the subject of many studies, whereas less attention has been given to hillslope recruitment, which is linked to episodic and spatially distributed events and requires a reliable and accurate slope stability model and a hillslope-channel transfer model.The purpose of this study is to develop an innovative LW hillslope-recruitment estimation approach that combines forest stand characteristics in a spatially distributed form, a probabilistic multidimensional slope stability model able to include the reinforcement exerted by roots, and a hillslope-channel transfer procedure. The approach was tested on a small mountain headwater catchment in the eastern Italian Alps that is prone to shallow landslide and debris flow phenomena. The slope stability model (that had not been calibrated) provided accurate performances, in terms of unstable areas identification according to the landslide inventory (AUC = 0.832) and of LW volume estimation in comparison with LW volume produced by inventoried landslides (7702 m3 corresponding to a recurrence time of about 30 years in the susceptibility curve). The results showed that most LW potentially mobilised by landslides does not reach the channel network (only about 16%), in agreement with the few data reported by other studies, as well as the data normalized for unit length of channel and unit length of channel per year (0–116 m3/km and 0–4 m3/km y−1).This study represents an important contribution to LW research. A rigorous and site-specific estimation of LW hillslope recruitment should, in fact, be an integral part of more general studies on LW dynamics, for forest planning and management, and positioning in-channel wood retention structures.Including forest stand characteristics into slope stability analysis.Modelling Large Wood recruited by hillslopes in mountainous catchments.Relating Large Wood recruitment volume and probability of occurrence.Large wood (LW) plays a key role in physical, chemical, environmental, and biological processes in most natural and seminatural streams.

15,A public health framework for the regulation of marketing,A. Biglan;M. Ryzin;E. Westling,Journal of Public Health Policy,"Cross-sectional, longitudinal, and experimental studies have found a link between youth exposure to cigarette marketing and youth initiation of smoking. These decisive research findings led to regulations of cigarette marketing to youth—including no television or radio ads, prohibitions on the use of cartoons, bans on transit and billboard advertisements, and disallowing tobacco brand sponsorships of sporting events or concerts. Similar products that may cause more harm than benefits include alcohol, electronic cigarettes, and opioids. We review the evidence linking problematic use of these products with exposure to marketing and discuss standards for assessing the potential harmfulness of marketing. We next address how public health agencies might apply regulatory principles to these harmful products similar to those applied to cigarette advertising, in the advancement of public health."

Effects were assessed through five annual surveys (time 1–5) of seventh and ninth grade (ages 12–15 years) students.INTERVENTION The community programme included: (a) media advocacy, (b) youth anti-tobacco activities, (c) family communications about tobacco use, and (d) reduction of youth access to tobacco.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The prevalence of self reported smoking and smokeless tobacco use in the week before assessment.RESULTS The community programme had significant effects on the prevalence of weekly cigarette use at times 2 and 5 and the effect approached significance at time 4. An effect on the slope of prevalence across time points was evident only when time 2 data points were eliminated from the analysis. The intervention affected the prevalence of smokeless tobacco among grade 9 boys at time 2. There were also significant effects on the slope of alcohol use among ninth graders and the quadratic slope of marijuana for all students.CONCLUSION The results suggest that comprehensive community wide interventions can improve on the preventive effect of school based tobacco prevention programmes and that effective tobacco prevention may prevent other substance use."
17,A randomized controlled trial: branched‐chain amino acid levels and glucose metabolism in patients with obesity and sleep apnea,A. Barceló;D. Morell‐Garcia;N. Salord;C. Esquinas;G. Pérez;A. Pérez;C. Monasterio;M. Gasa;A. Fortuna;J. Montserrat;M. Mayos,Journal of Sleep Research,"Summary There is evidence that changes in branched‐chain amino acid (BCAA) levels may correlate with the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for affecting improvement in metabolic control. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether serum concentrations of BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, valine) could mediate in insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A prospective randomized controlled trial of OSA patients with morbid obesity was conducted. Eighty patients were randomized into two groups: 38 received conservative treatment and 42 received CPAP treatment for 12 weeks. Plasma levels of BCAA, glucose tolerance and insulin resistance were evaluated at baseline and after treatment. After treatment, significant decreases of leucine levels were observed in both groups when compared with baseline levels (P < 0.005). With respect to patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) had higher baseline levels of isoleucine (78 ± 16 versus 70 ± 13 μmol L−1, P = 0.014) and valine (286 ± 36 versus 268 ± 41 μmol L−1, P = 0.049), respectively. Changes in levels of leucine and isoleucine after treatment were related negatively to changes in fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin values only in the conservative group (P < 0.05). In summary, we found that the treatment with CPAP for 12 weeks caused similar changes in circulating BCAAs concentrations to conservative treatment and a differential metabolic response of CPAP and conservative treatment was observed between the relationship of BCAAs and glucose homeostasis. Additional studies are needed to determine the interplay between branched‐chain amino acids and glucose metabolism in patients with sleep apnea."
18,A stigmergy-based analysis of city hotspots to discover trends and anomalies in urban transportation usage,A. Alfeo;M. Cimino;S. Egidi;B. Lepri;G. Vaglini,ArXiv Computer Science,"A key aspect of a sustainable urban transportation system is theeffectiveness of transportation policies. To be effective, a policy has toconsider a broad range of elements, such as pollution emission, traffic flow,and human mobility. Due to the complexity and variability of these elements inthe urban area, to produce effective policies remains a very challenging task.With the introduction of the smart city paradigm, a widely available amount ofdata can be generated in the urban spaces. Such data can be a fundamentalsource of knowledge to improve policies because they can reflect thesustainability issues underlying the city. In this context, we propose anapproach to exploit urban positioning data based on stigmergy, a bio-inspiredmechanism providing scalar and temporal aggregation of samples. By employingstigmergy, samples in proximity with each other are aggregated into afunctional structure called trail. The trail summarizes relevant dynamics indata and allows matching them, providing a measure of their similarity.Moreover, this mechanism can be specialized to unfold specific dynamics.Specifically, we identify high-density urban areas (i.e hotspots), analyzetheir activity over time, and unfold anomalies. Moreover, by matching activitypatterns, a continuous measure of the dissimilarity with respect to the typicalactivity pattern is provided. This measure can be used by policy makers toevaluate the effect of policies and change them dynamically. As a case study,we analyze taxi trip data gathered in Manhattan from 2013 to 2015."

Findings support the importance of intellectual style in achievement. Large sex differences were also obtained. Better understanding of the role of style in classroom performance would be particularly useful in view of the current desire to identify talent early and to foster its realization. (20 ref.)"
21,Adsorption of Crude Oil on Na+-Montmorillonite,A. Cosultchi;I. Cordova;M. Valenzuela;D. Acosta;P. Bosch;V. Lara,Energy & Fuels,"The interaction between a natural Na+-montmorillonite and a crude oil sample containing 2.5 wt % of asphaltene and 6.4 wt % of polar species is studied as a function of time. The microscopic and the macroscopic mechanisms of diffusion are examined and discussed. At a microscopic scale, diffusion of crude oil within the clay interlayer space is a slow and a continuous process with the formation of O/W microemulsions within the d(001) space, which involves those crude oil polar molecules with tensoactive properties, interlayer water molecules, and the clay Na+ interlayer cations. At a macroscopic scale, the diffusion of the organic species is also a slow but stepped process. At the beginning, such a process is controlled by a concentration gradient (the Fick law) of crude oil species which diffuses into clay pellet, and it is followed by a viscous flow-type diffusion, when the compacted clay mineral pellet is surrounded by a thick O/W emulsion of crude oil, clay colloids, and water expulsed from the interlayer space."

The process is conditioned by the petroleum paraffinic content and by molecules containing alkane chains, as only these type of compounds easy intercalate within the clay interlayer. Such adsorption also involves an irreversible displacement of part of the clay interlayer water. The partial dissolution of the clay matrix is indicated by XRD as an irreversible modification of the clay structure. On the contrary, adsorption of n-heptane or toluene molecules on the same clay are reversible processes, since the clay mineral recover its original crystalline structure after aging and evaporation of the organic species.Adsorption of petroleum organic compounds on natural Wyoming montmorillonite clay is an irreversible process, as most of organic species still remain adsorbed on mineral after aging.

On the contrary, adsorption of n-heptane or toluene molecules on the same clay are reversible processes, since the clay mineral recover its original crystalline structure after aging and evaporation of the organic species."
23,Affective modulation of the startle reflex and the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of personality: The role of sensitivity to reward,A. Aluja;A. Blanch;E. Blanco;F. Balada,Physiology and Behavior,"This study evaluated differences in the amplitude of startle reflex and Sensitivity to Reward (SR) and Sensitivity to Punishment (SP) personality variables of the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST). We hypothesized that subjects with higher scores in SR would obtain a higher startle reflex when exposed to pleasant pictures than lower scores, while higher scores in SP would obtain a higher startle reflex when exposed to unpleasant pictures than subjects with lower scores in this dimension. The sample consisted of 112 healthy female undergraduate psychology students. Personality was assessed using the short version of the Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ). Laboratory anxiety was controlled by the State Anxiety Inventory. The startle blink reflex was recorded electromyographically (EMG) from the right orbicularis oculi muscle as a response to the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) pleasant, neutral and unpleasant pictures. Subjects higher in SR obtained a significant higher startle reflex response in pleasant pictures than lower scorers (48.48 vs 46.28, p &lt; 0.012). Subjects with higher scores in SP showed a light tendency of higher startle responses in unpleasant pictures in a non-parametric local regression graphical analysis (LOESS). The findings shed light on the relationships among the impulsive–disinhibited personality, including sensitivity to reward and emotions evoked through pictures of emotional content.An assessment of the Lang paradigm about the differences in startle reflexUnpleasant pictures provided higher startle reflex than the neutral and pleasant.The pleasant pictures obtained a significant smaller startle reflex.Subjects higher in SR obtained higher startle reflex in pleasant pictures.This study evaluated differences in the amplitude of startle reflex and Sensitivity to Reward (SR) and Sensitivity to Punishment (SP) personality variables of the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST).

24,Aftershocks and the whole-life seismic performance of granular slopes,A. Al-Defae;K. Caucis;J. Knappett,Geotechnique,"Shallow embankment slopes are commonly used to support elements of transport infrastructure in seismic regions. In this paper, the seismic performance of such slopes in non-liquefiable granular soils is considered, focusing on permanent movement and dynamic motion at the crest, which would form key inputs into the aseismic design of supported infrastructure. In contrast to previous studies, the evolution of this behaviour under multiple sequential strong ground motions is studied through dynamic centrifuge, numerical (finite-element, FE) and analytical (sliding-block) modelling, the centrifuge tests being used to validate the two non-physical approaches. The FE models focus on the specification of model parameters for existing non-linear constitutive models using routine site investigation data, allowing them to be used routinely in design and analysis. Soil-specific constitutive parameters are derived from shearbox and oedometer test data, and are found to significantly outperform existing empirical correlations based on relative density, highlighting the importance of specifying a suitably detailed site investigation. An improved sliding-block (‘Newmark') approach is also developed for estimating permanent deformations during preliminary design, in which the formulation of the yield acceleration is fully strain-dependent, incorporating both material hardening/softening and geometric hardening (re-grading). The site-specific (improved) FE models and the new sliding-block approach are shown to outperform considerably existing FE parameters and sliding-block models in capturing the permanent deformations of the slope under virgin conditions, and further, only the improved FE and sliding-block models are found to capture correctly the behaviour of the ‘damaged' slope under subsequent earthquakes (e.g. strong aftershocks). The FE models can additionally accurately replicate the settlement profile at the crest and quantify the dynamic motions that would be input to supported structures, although these were generally overpredicted. The FE procedures and sliding-block models are therefore complementary, the latter being useful for preliminary design and the former for later detailed design and analysis."
25,Alesiellagen.n. and a newly discovered relict lineage of Staphylinini (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae),A. Brunke;A. Solodovnikov,Systematic Entomology,"This study aimed to identify the sister group of the poorly known and morphologically isolated Burmese species Quedius lineipennis within the tribe Staphylinini (Staphylinidae: Staphylininae) using morphological characters. Phylogenetic analysis of a broad taxon sample demonstrated that this Asian species is not a member of the genus Quedius but forms the sister taxon to the Neotropical genus Quediomacrus. Both taxa were shown to be members of a hitherto unrecognized lineage with a highly disjunct distribution. The lineage is hypothesized to be Asian in origin, with dispersals to the Americas during the early Eocene climatic maximum via Beringia and to Australia via land connections in the late Miocene. The current distribution of the lineage is considered to be relictual. New phylogenetic hypotheses within ‘Quediina’ and Staphylinini as a whole are proposed and the general tree topology of Staphylinini recovered by recent morphological studies is refined. Phylogenetic relationships within the Quedius complex remain unclear. Alesiella Brunke and Solodovnikov gen.n., is erected for Quedius lineipennis and the Quedius subgenus Quedionuchus is reinstated to genus level with new combinations as follows: Quedionuchus atl (Smetana, 1975), comb.n.; Quedionuchus calli (Smetana, 1976), comb.n.; Quedionuchus cipactli (Smetana, 1976), comb.n.; Quedionuchus coatl (Smetana, 1976), comb.n.; Quedionuchus ehacatl (Smetana, 1976), comb.n.; Quedionuchus ollin (Smetana, 1976), comb.n.; Quedionuchus ozomatli (Smetana, 1975), comb.n.; Quedionuchus reitterianus (Bernhauer, 1944), comb.n.; Quedionuchus samuraicus (Bernhauer and Schubert, 1916), comb.n.; Quedionuchus schultzei (Smetana, 1975), comb.n.; Quedionuchus tecpatl (Smetana, 1976), comb.n.; Quedionuchus xochitl (Smetana, 1976). Quedius lugubris Lokay, 1913 is transferred from the subgenus Quedionuchus to the subgenus Distichalius and placed in synonymy: Quedius punctatellus (Heer, 1839) = Quedius lugubris Lokay, 1913, syn.n."
26,Altered functionality in rhodopsin point mutants associated with retinitis pigmentosa,A. Andrés;P. Garriga;J. Manyosa,Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications,"Point mutations found in rhodopsin associated with the retinal degenerative disease retinitis pigmentosa have been expressed in mammalian COS-1 cells, purified, and characterised. The mutations characterised—most of them for the first time—have been Met44Thr, Gly114Asp, Arg135Leu, Val137Met, and Pro171Leu in the transmembrane domain; Leu328Pro and Ala346Pro in the C-terminal tail of the cytoplasmic domain; and Gly106Trp in the intradiscal domain. Several of these mutations cause misfolding which results in impaired 11-cis-retinal binding. Two of them, Met44Thr and Val137Met, show spectral and structural features similar to those of wild type rhodopsin (Type I mutants) but significantly increased transducin initial activation rates. We propose that, in the case of these mutants, abnormal functioning resulting in faster activation kinetics could also play a role in retinitis pigmentosa by altering the stoichiometric balance of the different proteins involved in the phototransduction biochemical reactions.Point mutations found in rhodopsin associated with the retinal degenerative disease retinitis pigmentosa have been expressed in mammalian COS-1 cells, purified, and characterised.

27,Alternative routes to steel based on hydrogen from cheap hydroelectric power,A. Antonioli,International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,"Unexploited hydroelectrical potential — plentiful all over the world, especially in developing areas — allows a production of cheap electrolytic hydrogen, transformable in industrial commodities liable of being conveniently transported. Two alternative routes to steel based upon such hydrogen are discussed. The evaluation of investment and operating costs leads to conclusions that the new routes are already competitive with respect to the traditional route blast furnace/oxygen converter, due to the rise in price of the fossil energy sources over the last years.∗ Competitiveness is likely to increase substantially in the long run. Unexploited power would be available for producing hundreds of millions of tons per year of steel. The possibility arises therefore to substitute on a vast scale a non-renewable fossil energy source (coking coal) with a renewable one, giving way also to tangible advantages from the ecological point of view.Unexploited hydroelectrical potential — plentiful all over the world, especially in developing areas — allows a production of cheap electrolytic hydrogen, transformable in industrial commodities liable of being conveniently transported.

Bergaoui,Applied Clay Science,"Manganese (II) carbonate, silicic acid and aluminum nitrate were treated hydrothermally at different temperatures (120–210°C) and for different durations (6–72 h) in an aqueous basic medium. Different compositions of starting mixtures were used. The synthetized materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, FTIR-spectroscopy, N2 adsorption analysis, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), thermal analysis (TG-DTG), Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-fluorescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and 29Si and 27Al MAS-NMR spectroscopy. The formation of kaolinite, smectite-like and Mn-containing lamellar phases was observed, but only in minor amounts contrary to previous studies. The majority phase was an original Al–Mn silicate with nanobubble-like morphology, a high surface area and mesoporosity, containing both Mn(IV) in lattice positions and Mn2 + as exchangeable cations. This amorphous Al–Mn-silicate nanobubbles phase seems to be an intermediate in a zeolite formation. Indeed, the increase of the reaction temperature, the reaction time or the reagent concentrations promoted the crystallization of a zeolite of the analcime type by transformation of the Al–Mn-silicate nanobubbles."
29,An Efficient Mechanism for UMTS Multicast Routing,A. Alexiou;C. Bouras;A. Papazois,Mobile Networks and Applications,"In this paper, we present a novel scheme for the multicast transmission of data over Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks. Apart from the normal multicast transmission over UMTS, we consider the handling of exceptional cases caused by user mobility scenarios. The proposed scheme is in accordance with the current specifications of the Multimedia Multicast/Broadcast Service (MBMS) defined by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and introduces minor modifications in the UMTS architecture and the mobility management mechanisms. The proposed scheme is implemented as an ns-2 network simulator module. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated and analyzed through ns-2 simulation experiments. This new module can be employed to investigate various aspects of UMTS multicast. Furthermore, in order to further highlight the contribution of our mechanism, we have implemented two multicast congestion control mechanisms for UMTS and we have measured their performance for MBMS transmissions."
30,An adaptive stigmergy-based system for evaluating technological indicator dynamics in the context of smart specialization,A. Alfeo;F. Appio;M. Cimino;A. Lazzeri;A. Martini;G. Vaglini,ArXiv Computer Science,"Regional innovation is more and more considered an important enabler ofwelfare. It is no coincidence that the European Commission has started lookingat regional peculiarities and dynamics, in order to focus Research andInnovation Strategies for Smart Specialization towards effective investmentpolicies. In this context, this work aims to support policy makers in theanalysis of innovation-relevant trends. We exploit a European database of theregional patent application to determine the dynamics of a set of technologicalinnovation indicators. For this purpose, we design and develop a softwaresystem for assessing unfolding trends in such indicators. In contrast withconventional knowledge-based design, our approach is biologically-inspired andbased on self-organization of information. This means that a functionalstructure, called track, appears and stays spontaneous at runtime when localdynamism in data occurs. A further prototyping of tracks allows a betterdistinction of the critical phenomena during unfolding events, with a betterassessment of the progressing levels. The proposed mechanism works ifstructural parameters are correctly tuned for the given historical context.Determining such correct parameters is not a simple task since differentindicators may have different dynamics. For this purpose, we adopt anadaptation mechanism based on differential evolution. The study includes theproblem statement and its characterization in the literature, as well as theproposed solving approach, experimental setting and results."

With this initialization strategy, convergence occurs with only a few iterations in the numerical method.

32,Analysis of Exonic Mutations Leading to Exon Skipping in Patients with Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1α Deficiency,A. Cardozo;L. Meirleir;I. Liebaers;W. Lissens,Pediatric Research,"The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is situated at a key position in energy metabolism and is responsible for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. In the literature, two unrelated patients with a PDH complex deficiency and splicing out of exon 6 of the PDH E1α gene have been described, although intronic/exonic boundaries on either side of exon 6 were completely normal. Analysis of exon 6 in genomic DNA of these patients revealed two exonic mutations, a silent and a missense mutation. Although not experimentally demonstrated, the authors in both publications suggested that the exonic mutations were responsible for the exon skipping. In this work, we were able to demonstrate, by performing splicing experiments, that the two exonic mutations described in the PDH E1α gene lead to aberrant splicing. We observed a disruption of the predicted wild-type pre-mRNA secondary structure of exon 6 by the mutated sequences described. However, when we constructed mutations that either reverted or disrupted the wild-type predicted pre-mRNA secondary structure of exon 6, we were unable to establish a correlation between the aberrant splicing and disruption of the predicted structure. The mutagenic experiments described here and the silent mutation found in one of the patients suggest the presence of an exonic splicing enhancer in the middle region of exon 6 of the PDH E1α gene.The pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is situated at a key position in energy metabolism and is responsible for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA.

33,Analysis of developing maize plastids reveals two mRNA stability classes correlating with RNA polymerase type,A. Cahoon;F. Harris;D. Stern,EMBO Reports,"The plastid genome is transcribed by two distinct RNA polymerases, the PEP encoded by the plastid genome and the NEP encoded in the nucleus. Initial models of plastid transcription held that the NEP is responsible for the transcription of housekeeping genes needed early in development, and that the PEP transcribes genes required for photosynthesis. Recently, this model was challenged by the discovery that all plastid genes are transcribed by NEP in PEP‐deficient tobacco plastids, suggesting that mRNA turnover may have a strong role in previously observed transcription patterns. In this study, we provide evidence that the NEP enzyme level decreases as plastids mature. In contrast, production of mRNAs by NEP increases as plastids mature, yet their accumulations remain constant. These results suggest that as plastids mature NEP may become more active, and that mRNA turnover varies between transcripts synthesized by NEP and PEP."
34,"Anisotropy, orbital order, and colossal electroresistance in untwinned La0.9Sr0.1MnO3 single crystals",A. Andrés;N. Biškup;M. García-Hernández;Y. Mukovskii,Physical Review B,"A magnetic and electric transport study of twinned and untwinned La1−xSrxMnO3 single crystals, with Sr content corresponding to a vertical phase diagram boundary (x≈0.1), is presented. The phases distinctive of both phase diagram sides are consecutively detected. All magnetic, transport, and electroresistance properties are found to be anisotropic. Below the ferromagnetic ordering, TC1=143 K, we have detected a second magnetic transition (TC2=125 K) with an easy ferromagnetic direction along the c axis and antiferromagnetic order (AF) along the a and/or b axes. The glassylike behavior of the ferromagnetic phase disappears when the AF correlations become long ranged. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy remains below the orbital ordering transition (TC3=73 K) with a strong anomaly in the coercive field at 30 K. The system is insulating at any temperature with different activation energies depending on the direction of the current below TC1. The observed magnetic anisotropy below TC2 is consistent with a homogeneous picture of the system as the ordered orbital polaron lattice proposed for the x=0.125 compound. Typical negative magnetoresistance (MR) for single crystals is detected, except at temperatures between both magnetic transitions, TC3<T<TC2, where the positive MR is due to the promotion of the orbital order. Applied magnetic fields up to 14 T could not remove the orbital order while low-current densities (j=10−8 A/cm2 at T=20 K), when applied along the AF axes, are able to destroy the orbital order and delocalize the carriers inducing a metalliclike conductivity and reducing the resistivity by a factor of up to 107. The observation of anisotropic electroresistance (ER) both in continuous and pulsed regimes, consistent with magnetic and transport anisotropies, as well as the low-current densities necessary to induce the phase transition, excludes Joule heating as the origin of the discontinuous high to low resistance transitions in these single crystals."
35,"Antioxidant enzyme activities, plasma hormone levels and serum metabolites of finishing broiler chickens reared under high ambient temperature and fed lemon and orange peel extracts and Curcuma xanthorrhiza essential oil",A. Akbarian;A. Golian;H. Kermanshahi;S. Smet;J. Michiels,Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition,"Summary The negative effects of high ambient temperature during some months of the year on poultry production have been of great concern in many countries. Dietary modifications are among the most practical ways to alleviate the effects of high temperature. Possible effects of dietary supplementation with 200 or 400 mg/kg feed of lemon peel extract (LPE), orange peel extract (OPE) and Curcuma xanthorrhiza essential oil (CXEO) under hot conditions (34 °C with 50% relative humidity for 5 h daily starting from day 28 until day 38 of age) on blood antioxidant enzyme activities, biochemical parameters and antibody titres of broiler chickens were investigated. All extracts are rich in phenolic compounds and highly available. Compared to control, supplementation with OPE at 400 mg/kg and CXEO significantly increased erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activity, plasma growth hormone concentrations and serum phosphorus, total protein and chloride concentrations and decreased serum low‐density lipoprotein and cholesterol concentrations in chickens at 38 days of age. Regarding antibody titres, CXEO supplementation at 400 mg/kg caused a significant increase in bronchitis antibody titres. Supplementation with LPE and OPE gave more inconsistent results. Most interesting, 400 mg/kg LPE significantly increased 3,5,3′‐triiodothyronine and GH concentration as compared to the control. In conclusion, the herbal extracts tested in this study, in particular CXEO at 400 mg/kg, may relieve some of the changes in blood composition induced by increased ambient temperatures."

37,Aqueous phase homogeneous catalysis using core–shell nanoreactors: Application to rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation of 1-octene,A. Cardozo;C. Julcour;L. Barthe;J. Blanco;H. Delmas,Journal of Catalysis,"High catalytic activity (turnover frequencies up to 700 h−1) was achieved using new triphenylphosphine-functionalized core cross-linked micelles, TPP@CCM, as nanoreactors and [Rh(acac)(CO)2] as catalyst precursor for the aqueous biphasic hydroformylation of 1-octene. While the hydrophobic core of the polymer offers an adequate environment for the catalytic reaction, its hydrophilic shell confines the catalyst into the aqueous phase and prevents extensive leaching toward the substrate/product phase. Selectivity is better than that of the homogeneous reaction catalyzed by the Rh/PPh3 system, with minor isomerization and linear to branched aldehyde ratios (l/b) between 3 and 6. Various operating parameters, such as catalyst/ligand concentration, temperature, and P/Rh ratio, were varied and proved that these nanoreactors do not suffer from significant mass transfer limitations. The effect of the nanoreactor hydrophobic core size and degree of functionalization on activity and on l/b regioselectivity has also been investigated. The possible causes of catalyst leaching are discussed."
38,Assessing Alternative Fuels for Helicopter Operation,A. Alexiou;A. Tsalavoutas;B. Pons;N. Aretakis;I. Roumeliotis;K. Mathioudakis,Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power,"At present, nearly 100% of aviation fuel is derived from petroleum using conventional and well known refining technology. However, the fluctuations of the fuel price and the vulnerability of crude oil sources have increased the interest of the aviation industry in alternate energy sources. The motivation of this interest is actually twofold: firstly, alternative fuels will help to stabilize price fluctuations by relieving the worldwide demand for conventional fuel. Secondly, alternative fuels could provide environmental benefits including a substantial reduction of emitted CO2 over the fuel life cycle. Thus, the ideal alternative fuel will fulfill both requirements: relieve the demand for fuels derived from crude oil and significantly reduce CO2 emissions. In the present paper, the effects of various alternative fuels on the operation of a medium transport/utility helicopter are investigated using performance models of the helicopter and its associated turboshaft engine. These models are developed in an object-oriented simulation environment that allows a direct mechanical connection to be established between them in order to create an integrated model. Considering the case of a typical mission for the specific helicopter/engine combination, a comparative evaluation of conventional and alternative fuels is then carried out and performance results are presented at both engine and helicopter levels."
39,Assessing Refugees' Integration via Spatio-Temporal Similarities of Mobility and Calling Behaviors,A. Alfeo;M. Cimino;B. Lepri;A. Pentland;G. Vaglini,IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems,"In Turkey, the increasing tension, due to the presence of 3.4 million Syrian refugees, demands the formulation of effective integration policies. Moreover, their design requires tools aimed at understanding the integration of refugees despite the complexity of this phenomenon. In this work, we propose a set of metrics aimed at providing insights and assessing the integration of Syrian refugees, by analyzing a real-world call detail record (CDR) dataset including calls from refugees and locals in Turkey throughout 2017. Specifically, we exploit the similarity between refugees’ and locals’ spatial and temporal behaviors, in terms of communication and mobility in order to assess integration dynamics. Together with the already known methods for data analysis, we use a novel computational approach to analyze spatio-temporal patterns: computational stigmergy, a bio-inspired scalar and temporal aggregation of samples. Computational stigmergy associates each sample with a virtual pheromone deposit (mark). Marks in spatiotemporal proximity are aggregated into functional structures called trails, which summarize the spatiotemporal patterns in data and allow computing the similarity between different patterns. According to our results, collective mobility and behavioral similarity with locals have great potential as measures of integration, since they are: 1) correlated with the amount of interaction with locals; 2) an effective proxy for refugee’s economic capacity, and thus refugee’s potential employment; and 3) able to capture events that may disrupt the integration phenomena, such as social tension."
40,Assessing age‐related ossification of the petro‐occipital fissure: Laying the foundation for understanding the clinicopathologies of the cranial base,A. Balboni;T. Estenson;J. Reidenberg;A. Bergemann;J. Laitman,The Anatomical Record,"The petro‐occitpital fissure (POF) lies within a critical interface of cranial growth and development in the posterior cranial fossa. The relationships between skeletal and soft tissues make this region especially important for examining biomechanical and basic biologic forces that may mold the cranial base and contribute to significant clinicopathologies associated with the structures located near the POF. Therefore, this study investigates the POF in adults in both preserved human cadavers and dried crania in order to determine if developmental changes can be observed and, if so, their value in age assessment as a model system for describing normal morphogenesis of the POF. This study demonstrates that tissue within the POF undergoes characteristic changes in ossification with age, the onset of which is considerably later than that of other synchondroses of the cranial base. Statistically, there is a moderate to strong correlation between age and stage of ossification within the POF. Further, male crania were observed to reach greater degrees of ossification at a younger age than female crania and that individual asymmetry in ossification of the tissue within the POF was not uncommon. An understanding of the basic temporal biological processes of the POF may yield insight into the development of clinicopathologies in this region of the cranial base. © 2004 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."

In this study, we used the Observing System Experiment (OSE) and Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) methodologies to estimate the impact of different FOS design and sensors implementation. OSEs were conducted to evaluate real observations and they show that the FOS network improves the analysis significantly, especially during the stratification season. Root mean square (RMS) of temperature errors are reduced by about 44% and 36% in the upper and lower layers respectively. We also demonstrated that a similar impact can be obtained with a reduced number of vessels if the spatial coverage of the data points does not change significantly. In the OSSE, the impact of the implementation of a CTD (conductivity–temperature–depth) sensor in place of the existing temperature sensor was tested with identical twin approaches between January and April 2007. The results imply that the assimilation of salinity does not improve the analysis significantly during the winter and spring seasons."
43,"Association of androgen receptor gene, CAG and GGN repeat length polymorphism and impulsive-disinhibited personality traits in inmates: the role of short–long haplotype",A. Aluja;L. García;A. Blanch;J. Fibla,Psychiatric Genetics,"Objective: This study analyses the association between impulsive-disinhibited personality traits and the androgen receptor CAG and GGN repeat polymorphisms in both inmates and control samples. Methods: We used two samples: 153 inmates (mean age= 33.31 years; standard deviation: 8.6; range: 20–63) and 108 controls (mean age= 26.71 years; standard deviation: 9.68; range: 17–53). A disinhibited personality construct was measured using the following personality scales: Sensation Seeking, Aggression-Hostility, Psychoticism, Sensitivity to Reward, Novelty Seeking and Impulsivity. A factor analysis of the six scales provided a normalized z index that was taken as a measure of impulsive-disinhibited personality . Results: Our data show that inmates carrying CAG short and GGN long haplotype group (short–long haplotype) obtained higher scores on all personality scales. Differences were found for the Impulsive Sensation-Seeking scale (age-adjusted multivariate analysis, P <0.016) and z index ( P <0.036). When comparing extreme groups in the impulsive-disinhibited personality index (taking the 75th percentile as a cut-off), carriers of the short–long haplotype were more prevalent in the extreme high group (30 vs. 10%: unadjusted odds ratio=3.8; 95% confidence interval=1.5–9.8; age-adjusted odds ratio=4.4; 95% confidence interval=1.6–12; P <0.004). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the androgen receptor CAG and GGN polymorphisms might influence impulsive-disinhibited personality traits."

Hannedouche,ChemCatChem,"With the rising interest in asymmetric catalysis promoted by earth‐abundant elements, a chiral ligand will undoubtedly be the most valuable unit of the catalyst. The first proof of concept of the use of a multitask chiral ligand in an asymmetric assisted tandem catalysis protocol that successively combines metallo‐ and organocatalytic processes is reported herein. In this protocol, the chiral ligand of the newly designed rare‐earth catalyst of the first reaction is converted into a novel chiral organocatalyst for the second transformation by the simple addition of HCl. The observation of some enantioinduction in the tandem sequence—alkyne hydroamination followed by enantioselective Friedel–Crafts alkylation—confirms the relay of the chiral N,N,N′,N′‐tetradentate ligand and the importance of its pyridylmethylamine scaffold."
45,Attractive S⋯π and π-π interactions in the pyrazine-2-thiocarboxamide structure: Experimental and computational studies in the context of crystal engineering and microbiological properties,A. Chylewska;A. Sikorski;M. Ogryzek;M. Makowski,Journal of Molecular Structure,"Pyrazine-2-thiocarboxamide (PTCA) was obtained after recrystallization and was characterised by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and thermogravimetry. Five dimers of PTCA were found in X-ray diffraction studies. These results were then compared with the known structures of a popular drug, i.e. pyrazine-2-carboxamide (PZA). S⋯π and π-π interactions were observed in the PTCA crystal structure as a novelty in X-ray measurements and our attention was focused on their role in stabilizing the PCTA structure. The geometry, energy and IR spectra for two conformers (E, Z) of PTCA and five dimers (D1-D5) were calculated for the gas phase with the DFT method at 6–311 + G(d,p) basis set. The results of calculations showed that D1 is the most stable dimer among five dimers of PTCA which were found experimentally. Thermal decomposition of PTCA was examined with the use of the TG/IR analysis (20–1000 °C) and the results were discussed. To test the antimicrobial activity of PTCA a biological assay was performed to determine its potentially pharmaceutical applications. The minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimal bactericidal (fungicidal) concentrations (MBC) for PTCA were determined against six microorganisms."

Dolan,Clinical Biomechanics,"Changes in the mean or median frequency of the electromyographic (EMG) power spectrum are often used to assess skeletal muscle fatigue. A more global analysis of the spectral changes using frequency banding may provide a more sensitive measure of fatigue than changes in mean or median frequency. So, the aim of the present study was to characterize changes in different power spectrum frequency bands and compare these with changes in median frequency.Twenty male subjects performed isometric contractions of the back muscles in an isometric dynamometer at 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% of maximum voluntary contraction. During each contraction, surface EMG signals were recorded from the right and left longissimus thoracis muscles, and endurance time was measured. The EMG power spectra were divided into four frequency bands (20–50 Hz; 50–80 Hz; 80–110 Hz; 110–140 Hz) and changes in power in each band with fatigue were compared with changes in median frequency.The percentage changes in 20–50 Hz band were greater than in all other and the rate of change in power, indicated by the slope, was also greatest in 20–50 Hz band. Also, 20–50 Hz band had a greater change in power than the median frequency.Power in the low frequency part of the EMG power spectrum increases with fatigue in a load-dependent manner.

47,Balancing Selection Maintains a Form of ERAP2 that Undergoes Nonsense-Mediated Decay and Affects Antigen Presentation,A. Andrés;M. Dennis;W. Kretzschmar;J. Cannons;S. Lee-Lin;B. Hurle;P. Schwartzberg;S. Williamson;C. Bustamante;R. Nielsen;A. Clark;E. Green,PLOS Genetics,"A remarkable characteristic of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is its extreme genetic diversity, which is maintained by balancing selection. In fact, the MHC complex remains one of the best-known examples of natural selection in humans, with well-established genetic signatures and biological mechanisms for the action of selection. Here, we present genetic and functional evidence that another gene with a fundamental role in MHC class I presentation, endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP2), has also evolved under balancing selection and contains a variant that affects antigen presentation. Specifically, genetic analyses of six human populations revealed strong and consistent signatures of balancing selection affecting ERAP2. This selection maintains two highly differentiated haplotypes (Haplotype A and Haplotype B), with frequencies 0.44 and 0.56, respectively. We found that ERAP2 expressed from Haplotype B undergoes differential splicing and encodes a truncated protein, leading to nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA. To investigate the consequences of ERAP2 deficiency on MHC presentation, we correlated surface MHC class I expression with ERAP2 genotypes in primary lymphocytes. Haplotype B homozygotes had lower levels of MHC class I expressed on the surface of B cells, suggesting that naturally occurring ERAP2 deficiency affects MHC presentation and immune response. Interestingly, an ERAP2 paralog, endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), also shows genetic signatures of balancing selection. Together, our findings link the genetic signatures of selection with an effect on splicing and a cellular phenotype. Although the precise selective pressure that maintains polymorphism is unknown, the demonstrated differences between the ERAP2 splice forms provide important insights into the potential mechanism for the action of selection."
48,Behavioural and physiological state dependency of host seeking in theblood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixusBehavioural and physiological state dependency of host seeking in theblood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixusBehavioural and physiological state dependency of host seeking in theblood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus,A. Bodin;C. Vinauger;C. Lazzari,Journal of Experimental Biology,"SUMMARY Vertebrate blood is essential for the growth and the reproduction ofhaematophagous insects. Provided that hosts play the double role of foodsources and predators, feeding on their blood exposes these insects to a highpredation risk. Therefore, it is expected that host seeking occurs only wheninsects need to feed. In the present study, we analyse how the feeding statusaffects the response to host-associated cues in the blood-sucking insectRhodnius prolixus. We show that the responsiveness to host-associatedcues, such as CO2 and heat, and that the motivation to feed dependon the time elapsed since a blood meal. Depending on the time elapsed afterfeeding, the same concentration of CO2 may attract or repel theinsects. As far as we know, this is the first time that a host signal has beenshown to be repellent for a haematophagous insect. The response to heat isalso modulated but no repellence was observed. When blood was replaced bysaline solution as food, a significant reduction of the response to bothsignals was evinced but repellence was not observed. The injection ofhaemolymph from fed insects into starved insects inhibited the response of thereceiver insects to both signals but this was not observed after the injectionof saline solution or of haemolymph from non-fed insects. This is the firsttime that the modulation of feeding behaviour by the feeding status has beenanalysed in a hemimetabolous blood-sucking insect, fully excluding any effectof other processes, such as reproduction."
49,Beta kernel quantile estimators of heavy-tailed loss distributions,A. Charpentier;A. Oulidi,Statistics and Computing,"In this paper we suggest several nonparametric quantile estimators based on Beta kernel. They are applied to transformed data by the generalized Champernowne distribution initially fitted to the data. A Monte Carlo based study has shown that those estimators improve the efficiency of the traditional ones, not only for light tailed distributions, but also for heavy tailed, when the probability level is close to 1. We also compare these estimators with the Extreme Value Theory Quantile applied to Danish data on large fire insurance losses."
50,Big but Imperceptible Adversarial Perturbations via Semantic Manipulation,A. Bhattad;M. Chong;K. Liang;B. Li;D. Forsyth,ArXiv Computer Science,"Machine learning, especially deep learning, is widely applied to a range of applications including computer vision, robotics and natural language processing. However, it has been shown that machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, carefully crafted samples that deceive learning models. In-depth studies on adversarial examples can help better understand potential vulnerabilities and therefore improve model robustness. Recent works have introduced various methods which generate adversarial examples. However, all require the perturbation to be of small magnitude ($\mathcal{L}_p$ norm) for them to be imperceptible to humans, which is hard to deploy in practice. In this paper we propose two novel methods, tAdv and cAdv, which leverage texture transfer and colorization to generate natural perturbation with a large $\mathcal{L}_p$ norm. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the proposed methods are general enough to attack both image classification and image captioning tasks on ImageNet and MSCOCO dataset. In addition, we conduct comprehensive user studies under various conditions to show that our generated adversarial examples are imperceptible to humans even when the perturbations are large. We also evaluate the transferability and robustness of the proposed attacks against several state-of-the-art defenses."

52,Black hole critical behavior with the generalized BSSN formulation,A. Akbarian;M. Choptuik,Physical Review D,"The development of hyperbolic formulations of Einstein’s equations has revolutionized our ability to perform long-time, stable, accurate numerical simulations of strong field gravitational phenomena. However, hyperbolic methods have seen relatively little application in one area of interest, type II critical collapse, where the challenges for a numerical code are particularly severe. Using the critical collapse of a massless scalar field in spherical symmetry as a test case, we study a generalization of the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura formulation due to Brown that is suited for use with curvilinear coordinates. We adopt standard dynamical gauge choices, including 1+log slicing and a shift that is either zero or evolved by a Gamma-driver condition. With both choices of shift we are able to evolve sufficiently close to the black hole threshold to (1) unambiguously identify the discrete self-similarity of the critical solution, (2) determine an echoing exponent consistent with previous calculations, and (3) measure a mass scaling exponent, also in accord with prior computations. Our results can be viewed as an encouraging first step towards the use of hyperbolic formulations in more generic type II scenarios, including the as yet unresolved problem of critical collapse of axisymmetric gravitational waves."

Titti,Journal of Virology,"The infection of CD4-negative cells by variants of tissue culture-adapted human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or HIV-2 strains has been shown to be mediated by the CXCR4 coreceptor. Here we show that two in vitro-established CD4−/CCR5−/CXCR4+ human pre-T-cell lines (A3 and A5) can be productively infected by wild-type laboratory-adapted T-cell-tropic HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains in a CD4-independent, CXCR4-dependent fashion. Despite the absence of CCR5 expression, A3 and A5 cells were susceptible to infection by the simian immunodeficiency viruses SIVmac239 and SIVmac316. Thus, at least in A3 and A5 cells, one or more of the chemokine receptors can efficiently support the entry of HIV and SIV isolates in the absence of CD4. These findings suggest that to infect cells of different compartments, HIV and SIV could have evolved in vivo to bypass CD4 and to interact directly with an alternative receptor."

The process requires a range of possible interventions including organisational consultancy, practice consultancy and staff support, specialist training and explorations of team processes."
56,Can vouchers reduce elite capture of local development projects? Experimental evidence from the Solomon Islands,A. Beath;A. Benyishay;G. D'Adda;P. Grosjean;R. Weber,Journal of Public Economics,"External financing of local public goods can potentially create ‘political resource curses' by reducing citizen oversight, exacerbating elite capture, and producing policy outcomes that are sub-optimal for the general population. This paper experimentally tests a novel mechanism that seeks to mitigate elite capture of local development projects. Control communities are provided with block grants to fund local public goods, while households in treatment communities are provided with vouchers that they may either contribute to a public good or redeem at a discount for a private capital good. We find that the use of vouchers as a mechanism for aid delivery increases community participation in local public decision-making, changes the nature of allocation outcomes, and improves community satisfaction with allocation outcomes."
57,Centrifuge Modeling of the Seismic Performance of Pile-Reinforced Slopes,A. Al-Defae;J. Knappett,Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering,"An extensive program of centrifuge testing was conducted to quantify the improvements to seismic slope performance that can be achieved by installing a row of discretely spaced vertical precast RC piles. A key novelty of the work presented is the use of recently developed microreinforced concrete to produce realistically damageable model piles. Pile-reinforced slopes are a good example of a problem in which relative soil-pile strength is important in determining whether the soil or pile yields first, and in which the performance of a slope with structurally damaged piles may be of interest. The new model RC allows these factors to be properly accounted for in a reduced-scale physical model for the first time. Two different reinforcement layouts were considered, representing (1) a section specifically detailed to carry the bending moments induced by the slipping soil mass, and (2) a nominally reinforced section with low moment capacity. These were supported by further tests on conventional elastic piles that were instrumented to measure seismic soil-pile interaction. It was demonstrated that dynamic ground motions at the crest can be significantly reduced in amplitude by up to 20% with elastic piles spaced at s/B=3.5, both in terms of the peak acceleration and across the full response spectrum. Permanent deformations at the slope crest (e.g., settlement) were also reduced by up to 35% at s/B=3.5. These findings are consistent with previous suggestions made for the optimal s/B ratio for encouraging soil arching between piles at maximum spacing both under monotonic conditions and from numerical investigations of the seismic problem. The improvements to slope performance were reduced slightly using the designed microreinforced concrete piles owing to deterioration in the bending properties arising from fatigue under the cyclic kinematic loading. This suggests that idealization of RC piles as elastic elements will likely be only an approximation of their true behavior. The importance of reinforcement detailing was also highlighted, with the nominally reinforced section yielding early in the earthquake, and the damaged piles subsequently only offering a small (although measureable) reduction in seismic slope performance compared with the unreinforced case. In addition to these findings, the data presented will be useful in validating future improved numerical models for predicting the performance of piled slopes and for the aseismic design of pile-reinforcing schemes."
58,Challenges and Trends in the Design of a New Air Interface,A. Alexiou;D. Falconer,IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine,"The wide variety of envisioned data services and the requirements for transparent operation across different technologies, adaptivity to varying network conditions and quality of service (QoS) constraints introduce a number of challenges in the design of future generation systems and the specification of a new air interface, such as efficiency in the utilization of spectrum, dynamic resource allocation and interference management. Air interfaces will likely be reconfigurable, based on frequency domain transmission and reception methods, and adaptively selecting the uplink and downlink modulation and multiple access scheme that is most appropriate for the channel, interference, traffic and cost constraints. In this paper the challenges in the design of a new air interface are analyzed, a number of enabling technologies, such as smart antennas and relay-based systems, that help address these challenges, are presented, and critical parameters and open issues are discussed"
59,Characterization of Modified Fischer–Tropsch Catalysts Promoted with Alkaline Metals for Higher Alcohol Synthesis,A. Cosultchi;M. Pérez-Luna;J. Morales-Serna;M. Salmón,Catalysis Letters,"Two series of Cu/Co/Cr modified Fischer–Tropsch catalyst promoted with Zn or Mn and an alkaline metal (Me: Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) were prepared by co-precipitation method and tested for high alcohol synthesis (HAS) at one hour on-stream and at two temperatures, 300 and 350 °C. The results indicate that the best selectivity toward high alcohols depends on temperature and catalysts composition and is obtained as follows: a) at 300 °C over catalysts without Zn and containing K, Na and Rb; b) at 350 °C over catalysts without Zn and containing K; c) at 350 °C over catalysts containing Zn as well as Li and Cs. Graphical Abstract Two series of Cu/Co/Cr modified Fischer–Tropsch catalyst promoted with Zn or Mn and an alkaline metal (Me: Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) were prepared by co-precipitation method and tested for HAS at one hour on-stream and at two temperatures, 300 and 350 °C.

60,Characterization of injury in isolated rat proximal tubules during cold incubation and rewarming,A. Bienholz;B. Walter;G. Pless-Petig;H. Guberina;A. Kribben;O. Witzke;U. Rauen,PLOS ONE (Physical Sciences),"Organ shortage leads to an increased utilization of marginal organs which are particularly sensitive to storage-associated damage. Cold incubation and rewarming-induced injury is iron-dependent in many cell types. In addition, a chloride-dependent component of injury has been described. This work examines the injury induced by cold incubation and rewarming in isolated rat renal proximal tubules. The tissue storage solution TiProtec® and a chloride-poor modification, each with and without iron chelators, were used for cold incubation. Incubation was performed 4°C for up to 168 h, followed by rewarming in an extracellular buffer (3 h at 37°C). After 48, 120 and 168 h of cold incubation LDH release was lower in solutions containing iron chelators. After rewarming, injury increased especially after cold incubation in chelator-free solutions. Without addition of iron chelators LDH release showed a tendency to be higher in chloride-poor solutions. Following rewarming after 48 h of cold incubation lipid peroxidation was significantly decreased and metabolic activity was tendentially better in tubules incubated with iron chelators. Morphological alterations included mitochondrial swelling and fragmentation being partially reversible during rewarming. ATP content was better preserved in chloride-rich solutions. During rewarming, there was a further decline of ATP content in the so far best conditions and minor alterations under the other conditions, while oxygen consumption was not significantly different compared to non-stored control tubules. Results show an iron-dependent component of preservation injury during cold incubation and rewarming in rat proximal renal tubules and reveal a benefit of chloride for the maintenance of tubular energy state during cold incubation."
61,Chromatographic models to predict the elution of ionizable analytes by organic modifier gradient in reversed phase liquid chromatography,A. Andrés;A. Téllez;M. Rosés;E. Bosch,Journal of Chromatography A,"The retention of an ionizable analyte under RP-HPLC organic modifier gradient elution is strongly affected by its ionization degree which, in turn, depends on its pKa and on the pH of the mobile phase. The values of both parameters change depending on the mobile phase composition and thus retention becomes a parameter quite difficult to predict, particularly when working in gradient mode. In this work, an equation describing the retention of ionizable analytes has been combined with three different models of different complexity, developed for gradient elution of neutral compounds (1, 2, or 3 fitting parameters), in order to predict retention of compounds with acid–base properties with particular buffers. All models have been tested under 16 different gradient patterns (4 linear gradients, 4 concave gradients, 4 convex gradients and 4 combinations between them) for the prediction of the retention time of 12 acid–base compounds (pKa values from 4 to 9) in 3 different buffered mobile phases (pH 5, pH 7 and pH 9) with acetonitrile as organic modifier. The agreement between the experimental and calculated retention times is good for all models. The best results are obtained through the model that depends on three parameters and the accuracy of the two-parameter model is slightly lower but very acceptable too. On the other hand, the predictions performed with the one-parameter model are the less accurate, but good enough to become a valid model taking into account that it requires very little experimental work.The retention of an ionizable analyte under RP-HPLC organic modifier gradient elution is strongly affected by its ionization degree which, in turn, depends on its pKa and on the pH of the mobile phase.

62,Chronic sublethal exposure to silver nanoparticles disrupts thyroid hormone signaling during Xenopus laevis metamorphosis,A. Carew;M. Hoque;C. Metcalfe;C. Peyrot;C. Helbing,Aquatic Toxicology,"Nanoparticles (NPs) are engineered in the nanoscale (&lt;100 nm) to have unique physico-chemical properties from their bulk counterparts. Nanosilver particles (AgNPs) are the most prevalent NPs in consumer products due to their strong antimicrobial action. While AgNP toxicity at high concentrations has been thoroughly investigated, the sublethal effects at or below regulatory guidelines are relatively unknown. Amphibian metamorphosis is mediated by thyroid hormone (TH), and initial studies with bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) indicate that low concentrations of AgNPs disrupt TH-dependent responses in premetamorphic tadpole tailfin tissue. The present study examined the effects of low, non-lethal, environmentally-relevant AgNP concentrations (0.018, 0.18 or 1.8 μg/L Ag; ∼10 nm particle size) on naturally metamorphosing Xenopus laevis tadpoles in two-28 day chronic exposures beginning with either pre- or prometamorphic developmental stages. Asymmetric flow field flow fractionation with online inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and nanoparticle tracking analysis indicated a mixture of single AgNPs with homo-agglomerates in the exposure water with a significant portion (∼30–40%) found as dissolved Ag. Tadpoles bioaccumulated AgNPs and displayed transient alterations in snout/vent and hindlimb length with AgNP exposure. Using MAGEX microarray and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction transcript analyses, AgNP-induced disruption of five TH-responsive targets was observed. The increased mRNA abundance of two peroxidase genes by AgNP exposure suggests the presence of reactive oxygen species even at low, environmentally-relevant concentrations. Furthermore, differential responsiveness to AgNPs was observed at each developmental stage. Therefore, low concentrations of AgNPs had developmental stage-specific endocrine disrupting effects during TH-dependent metamorphosis.Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are commonly found in consumer products.Frog tadpoles undergoing metamorphosis were exposed to low, sublethal amounts.Differential bioaccumulation of AgNPs was observed depending on developmental stage.Thyroid hormone-dependent gene transcript abundance was affected by AgNPs.Transcriptomic analyses suggest reactive oxygen species were generated.Nanoparticles (NPs) are engineered in the nanoscale (&lt;100 nm) to have unique physico-chemical properties from their bulk counterparts. Nanosilver particles (AgNPs) are the most prevalent NPs in consumer products due to their strong antimicrobial action. While AgNP toxicity at high concentrations has been thoroughly investigated, the sublethal effects at or below regulatory guidelines are relatively unknown. Amphibian metamorphosis is mediated by thyroid hormone (TH), and initial studies with bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) indicate that low concentrations of AgNPs disrupt TH-dependent responses in premetamorphic tadpole tailfin tissue. The present study examined the effects of low, non-lethal, environmentally-relevant AgNP concentrations (0.018, 0.18 or 1.8 μg/L Ag; ∼10 nm particle size) on naturally metamorphosing Xenopus laevis tadpoles in two-28 day chronic exposures beginning with either pre- or prometamorphic developmental stages. Asymmetric flow field flow fractionation with online inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and nanoparticle tracking analysis indicated a mixture of single AgNPs with homo-agglomerates in the exposure water with a significant portion (∼30–40%) found as dissolved Ag. Tadpoles bioaccumulated AgNPs and displayed transient alterations in snout/vent and hindlimb length with AgNP exposure. Using MAGEX microarray and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction transcript analyses, AgNP-induced disruption of five TH-responsive targets was observed. The increased mRNA abundance of two peroxidase genes by AgNP exposure suggests the presence of reactive oxygen species even at low, environmentally-relevant concentrations. Furthermore, differential responsiveness to AgNPs was observed at each developmental stage. Therefore, low concentrations of AgNPs had developmental stage-specific endocrine disrupting effects during TH-dependent metamorphosis."
63,Circulation of the Turkish Straits System under interannual atmospheric forcing,A. Aydoğdu;N. Pinardi;E. Özsoy;G. Danabasoglu;Ö. Gürses;A. Karspeck,Ocean Science,"A simulation of the Turkish StraitsSystem (TSS) using a high-resolution, three-dimensional, unstructured meshocean circulation model with realistic atmospheric forcing for the 2008–2013period is presented. The depth of the pycnocline between the upper and lowerlayers remains stationary after 6 years of integration, indicating thatdespite the limitations of the modelling system, the simulation maintains itsrealism. The solutions capture important responses to high-frequencyatmospheric events such as the reversal of the upper layer flow in theBosphorus due to southerly severe storms, i.e. blocking events, to the extentthat such storms are present in the forcing dataset. The annual averagecirculations show two distinct patterns in the Sea of Marmara. When the windstress maximum is localised in the central basin, the Bosphorus jet flows tothe south and turns west after reaching the Bozburun Peninsula. In contrast,when the wind stress maximum increases and expands in the north–southdirection, the jet deviates to the west before reaching the southern coastand forms a cyclonic gyre in the central basin. In certain years, the meankinetic energy in the northern Sea of Marmara is found to be comparable tothat of the Bosphorus inflow."

Westreenen;J. Pitout,Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy,"We investigated the clinical and molecular characteristics of bacteremia caused by extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli over a 2-year period (2008 to 2009) in the Rotterdam region (including 1 teaching hospital and 2 community hospitals) of Netherlands. The majority of patients presented with community onset urinary and intra-abdominal infections, with an increase in prevalence during 2009. The majority of E. coli isolates produced CTX-M-15, and 4 sequence types (ST38, ST131, ST405, and ST648) predominated. There were significant differences in clinical and molecular characteristics between the 2 community hospitals."

Sciuto,IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,"This paper presents a methodology for the automatic generation of clock trees in an ASIC design at the gate level. New algorithms and heuristics are described: they have been inserted with success in an industrial ASIC design flow, after the logic synthesis and optimization step. Our algorithms, by different heuristic methods, particularly take into account those elements connected as transmitter-receiver couples which represent the most critical configurations for circuit synchronization. Improvement of clock tree performance has also been obtained by means of an interaction strategy between logic and physical design phases. Such a strategy drives the placement of the clock tree elements in an equidistant way, in order to obtain a controlled routing."
66,Cluster Randomized Trial of Social Accountability Interventions in Cambodia,A. Beath;P. Trang;W. Yen,AEA RCT Registry,"Despite a decade of rapid economic growth, the access of Cambodian villagers to public services and facilities is still among the lowest in the region. Such failures in service delivery are considered by development agencies and researchers to be at least partially due to limited citizen engagement with local public institutions, which in turn reduces the responsiveness of service providers to the needs of the population. In order to enhance the accountability of service providers and local officials and, as a result, improve the quality of service delivery, the Cambodian government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and bilateral donors have – with assistance from the World Bank through the Voice and Action Program (VAP) – developed the Social Accountability Framework (SAF). Whereas evaluations of social accountability interventions in other contexts indicate that such interventions have been unsuccessful due to a failure to provide service providers and local officials with incentives to change their behavior, the design of the SAF builds on lessons from the body existing research by providing for coordinated interventions by both state and non-state actors. The Voice and Action Program (VAP) Impact Evaluation (VAP-IE) will use a randomized controlled trial conducted across 42 districts in 15 provinces of Cambodia to determine whether the coordinated interventions mandated by SAF improve the quality of educational, health, and commune services provided to villagers in rural Cambodia and increase villagers’ engagement with local government. Evidence from the VAP-IE will be used by national authorities, NGOs, bilateral donors, and the World Bank to inform future funding and design decisions related to the National Decentralization Reform. The VAP-IE is also expected to contribute to general knowledge on the efficacy of social accountability interventions by providing a rigorous assessment of whether an innovative program that coordinates interventions by state and non-state actors can be successful in enforcing accountability and improving the quality of service delivery."
67,Coexistence of spin-glass and ferromagnetic order in the ±J Heisenberg spin-glass model,A. Beath;D. Ryan,Physical Review B,"Monte Carlo simulations of the bond-frustrated ±J Heisenberg model confirm the existence of a finite temperature spin-glass transition at TSG=0.220(5). Remarkably, this transition temperature is composition dependent, rising to TSG=0.25(1) by the ferromagnet–spin-glass boundary. Coexistence of ferromagnetic and spin-glass ordering is observed at low frustration levels for T<Txy, and the composition dependence of this transition is also followed. The behavior we observe below Txy agrees with both the mean field prediction and the experimental observations while being inconsistent with “re-entrance,” which demands a loss of ferromagnetic order. The complete phase diagram is presented."

To determine the correlation between CogSport and two conventional neuropsychological tests. Design: Prospective, serial investigation of cognitive function. Setting: Professional and semi-professional Australian Football clubs and a university affiliated research institute in Melbourne, Australia. Participants: Three-hundred healthy young adults, including 240 elite athletes. Main Outcome Measures: Intra-class correlation (ICC) coefficients for CogSport performance measures administered serially. ICC between CogSport performance measures and conventional neuropsychological tests. Normative data for CogSport performance measures. Results: Measures of psychomotor function, decision making, working memory and learning were highly reliable. Some measures also displayed high correlations with conventional neuropsychological tests of information processing and attention. Preliminary normative data is described. Conclusions: CogSport is a highly reliable cognitive function test when administered to healthy young adults and elite athletes. CogSport measures similar cognitive functions as conventional tests used commonly in concussion research."
69,Cognition in the days following concussion: comparison of symptomatic versus asymptomatic athletes,A. Collie;M. Makdissi;P. Maruff;K. Bennell;P. Mccrory,"Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry","Background: Concussion is a common neurological injury occurring during contact sport. Current guidelines recommend that no athlete should return to play while symptomatic or displaying cognitive dysfunction. This study compared post-concussion cognitive function in recently concussed athletes who were symptomatic/asymptomatic at the time of assessment with that of non-injured (control) athletes.Methods: Prospective study of 615 male Australian Rules footballers. Before the season, all participants (while healthy) completed a battery of baseline computerised (CogSport) and paper and pencil cognitive tasks. Sixty one injured athletes (symptomatic = 25 and asymptomatic = 36) were reassessed within 11 days of being concussed; 84 controls were also reassessed. The serial cognitive function of the three groups was compared using analysis of variance.Results: The performance of the symptomatic group declined at the post-concussion assessment on computerised tests of simple, choice, and complex reaction times compared with the asymptomatic and control groups. The magnitude of changes was large according to conventional statistical criteria. On paper and pencil tests, the symptomatic group displayed no change at reassessment, whereas large improvements were seen in the other two groups.Conclusion: Injured athletes experiencing symptoms of concussion displayed impaired motor function and attention, although their learning and memory were preserved. These athletes displayed no change in performance on paper and pencil tests in contrast with the improvement observed in asymptomatic and non-injured athletes. Athletes experiencing symptoms of concussion should be withheld from training and competition until both symptoms and cognitive dysfunction have resolved."
70,Coherent state monitoring in quantum dots,A. Al-Ahmadi;S. Ulloa,Physical Review B,"We study the dynamics of excitonic states in dimer and trimer arrangements of colloidal quantum dots using a density-matrix approach. The dots are coupled via a dipole-dipole interaction akin to the Förster mechanism. Coherent oscillations of tuned donor dots are shown to appear as plateaus in the acceptor dot, and therefore in its optical response. This behavior provides one with an interesting and unique handle to monitor the quantum state of the dimer, an “eavesdroping arrangement.” A trimer cluster in a symmetrical loop shows steady states in a shorter characteristic time than the typical radiative lifetime of the dots. Breaking the symmetry of the loop results again in damping oscillatory states in the donor dots and plateaus in the eavesdropping∕acceptor dot. The use of realistic parameters allows direct comparison with recent experiments and indicates that coherent-state monitoring is possible in real experiments."
71,Collaboration changes both the content and the structure of memory: Building the architecture of shared representations.,A. Congleton;S. Rajaram,Journal of Experimental Psychology: General,"Memory research has primarily focused on how individuals form and maintain memories across time. However, less is known about how groups of people working together can create and maintain shared memories of the past. Recent studies have focused on understanding the processes behind the formation of such shared memories, but none has investigated the structure of shared memory. This study investigated the circumstances under which collaboration would influence the likelihood that participants come to share both a similar content and a similar organization of the past by aligning their individual representations into a shared rendering. We tested how the frequency and the timing of collaboration affect participants’ retrieval organization, and how this in turn influences the formation of shared memory and its persistence over time. Across numerous foundational and novel analyses, we observed that as the size of the collaborative inhibition effect—a counterintuitive finding that collaboration reduces group recall—increased, so did the amount of shared memory and the shared organization of memories. These findings reveal the interconnected relationship between collaborative inhibition, retrieval disruption, shared memory, and shared organization. Together, these relationships have intriguing implications for research across a wide variety of domains, including the formation of collective memory, beliefs and attitudes, parent–child narratives and the development of autobiographical memory, and the emergence of shared representations in educational settings."
72,"Combining a rainfall–runoff model and a regionalization approach for flood and water resource assessment in the western Po Valley, Italy",A. Cislaghi;D. Masseroni;C. Massari;S. Camici;L. Brocca,Hydrological Sciences Journal,"Selecting the best structure and parameterization of rainfall–runoff models is not straightforward and depends on a broad number of factors. In this study, the “Modello Idrologico Semi-Distribuito in continuo” (MISDc) was tested on 63 mountainous catchments in the western Po Valley (Italy) and the optimal model parameters were regionalized using different strategies. The model performance was evaluated through several indexes analysing hydrological regime, high-flow condition and flow–duration curve (FDC). In general, MISDc provides a good fit behaviour with a Kling-Gupta Efficiency index greater than 0.5 for 100% and 84% of cases for calibration and validation respectively. Concerning the regionalization, spatial proximity approach is the most accurate solution obtaining satisfactory performance. Lastly, the predicted FDCs showed an excellent similarity with the observed ones. Results encourage to apply MISDc over the study area for flood forecasting and for assessing water resources availability thanks to the modest computational efforts and data requirements."
73,Comparative Performances of Birnessite and Cryptomelane MnO2 as Electrode Material in Neutral Aqueous Lithium Salt for Supercapacitor Application,A. Boisset;L. Athouël;J. Jacquemin;P. Porion;T. Brousse;M. Anouti,Journal of Physical Chemistry C,"Na-doped Birnessite-type manganese oxide (δ-MnO2) has been synthesized using the chemical method and characterized through X-ray diffraction and SEM, showing the lamellar structure and high crystal structure. A comparative study of the electrochemical performances of this material with those of the commercial Cryptomelane-type MnO2 has then been undertaken in ten neutral aqueous electrolytes for supercapacitor applications. Aqueous electrolytes, containing a lithium salt, LiX (where X = SO42–, NO3–, CH3CO2–, CH3SO3–, ClO4–, C7H15CO2–, TFSI–, Beti–, BOB–, or Lact–), have been first prepared under neutral pH conditions to reach the salt concentration, providing the maximum in conductivity. Their transport properties are then investigated through conductivities, viscosities, and self-diffusion coefficient measurements. Second, the thermal behaviors of these electrolytic aqueous solutions are then evaluated by using a differential scanning calorimeter from (213.15 to 473.15) K in order to access their liquid range temperatures. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) in three electrode configurations are thereafter investigated using Na Birnessite and Cryptomelane as working electrode material from (−0.05 to 1.5) V versus Ag/AgCl at various sweep rates from (2 to 100) mV·s–1. According to anion nature/structure and manganese oxide material type, different CV responses are observed, presenting a pure capacitive profile for Beti– or C6H13CO2– and an additional pseudocapacitive signal for the smallest anions, such as ClO4– and NO3–. The capacitances, energies, and efficiencies are finally calculated. These results indicate clearly that electrolytes based on a mineral lithium salt under neutral pH condition and high salt concentration (up to 5 mol·L–1) have better electrochemical performances than organic ones, up to 1.4 V with good material stability and capacity retention. The relationship between transport properties, electrostatic and steric hindrance considerations of hydrated ions, and their electrochemical performances is discussed in order to understand further the lithium intercalation–deintercalation processes in the lamellar or tunnel structure of investigated MnO2."
74,Comparing the asymptotic power of exact tests in 2×2 tables,A. Andrés;A. Mato;J. Garcı́A;M. Quevedo,Computational Statistics and Data Analysis,"A 2×2 table may arise from three types of sampling, depending on the number of previously fixed marginals, and may yield three possible, differing, probabilistic models. From the unconditional point of view each model requires a specific solution but, within each model, the calculation time increases as the test procedure chosen is more powerful and, between the models, the calculation time decreases in the number of marginals fixed. Moreover, each model yields a test which is generally more powerful than the test of any other model with a larger number of marginals fixed. The condition under which a less powerful test, of the same or a different model, can substitute a more powerful test with a loss of power lower than 2% is determined. It is concluded that the Fisher exact test can be used as an approximation to Barnard's exact test for a table with 0 or 1 fixed marginals, when the sample size is ⩾100 or when the smaller sample size is ⩾80, respectively. Similarly, Barnard's exact test for a table with 1 fixed marginal can be used as an approximation of the same test for a table with 0 fixed marginals, when the sample size is ⩾50."
75,Computerised cognitive assessment of athletes with sports related head injury,A. Collie;D. Darby;P. Maruff,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Professional and amateur participants in many sports are at risk of brain injury caused by impact with other players or objects. In many cases, mild cognitive deficits may persist after the common neurological signs of brain injury have passed. In recent years, the athlete's cognitive status after concussion has been measured with conventional “paper and pencil” neuropsychological tests. However, such tests are not ideal for sporting settings, as they are designed for the detection of gross cognitive impairments at a single assessment, not for the identification of mild cognitive deficits on repeated assessment. A number of computerised cognitive assessment tests and test batteries have been developed over the past two decades. These batteries offer major scientific and practical advantages over conventional neuropsychological tests which make them ideal for the assessment of cognitive function in sportspeople. This review first describes the problems associated with cognitive assessment of people with sports related cognitive deficits, and then critically examines the utility of conventional neuropsychological and computerised cognitive tests in sporting settings."
76,Condom Use Rather Than Serosorting Explains Differences in HIV Incidence Among Men Who Have Sex With Men,A. Bij;M. Kolader;H. Vries;M. Prins;R. Coutinho;N. Dukers,Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes,"Background: HIV incidence is high and increasing among men who have sex with men (MSM) attending the Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) Outpatient Clinic in Amsterdam but remains low among MSM in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS). We studied whether sexual behaviors in these 2 groups are consistent with serosorting and if serosorting explains the difference in HIV incidence. Methods: In 2004 to 2006, a survey of sexual behaviors and HIV status regarding up to 4 traceable partners in the prior 6 months was performed in MSM attending the STI Outpatient Clinic (high-risk) and in MSM in the ACS (lower risk). Moreover, pooled information was collected on anonymous partners. We used logistic regression to test whether sexual behaviors are consistent with serosorting and to test whether risk group is associated with having concordant traceable partners among men reporting unprotected anal intercourse (UAI). Results: We included 513 MSM (54% lower risk and 75% HIV -negative). Lower risk and high-risk MSM with concordant traceable partners were more likely to have UAI than MSM with discordant partners or partners of unknown HIV status ( P < 0.001). Risk group was not associated with having concordant UAI. Compared with lower risk MSM, however, high-risk MSM frequently had UAI with nonconcordant traceable partners and with anonymous partners. Conclusions: Sexual risk behaviors with traceable partners are consistent with serosorting . Nonetheless, the higher level of UAI with anonymous or nonconcordant traceable partners more likely explains the increasing HIV incidence seen among STI Outpatient Clinic attendees than a difference in serosorting behavior."
77,Constrained and unconstrained Gibbs free energy minimization in reactive systems using genetic algorithm and differential evolution with tabu list,A. Bonilla-Petriciolet;G. Rangaiah;J. Segovia-Hernández,Fluid Phase Equilibria,"Phase equilibrium modeling plays an important role in design, optimization and control of separation processes. The global optimization problem involved in phase equilibrium calculations is very challenging due to the high non-linearity of thermodynamic models especially for multi-component systems subject to chemical reactions. To date, a few attempts have been made in the application of stochastic methods for reactive phase equilibrium calculations compared to those reported for non-reactive systems. In particular, the population-based stochastic methods are known for their good exploration abilities and, when optimal balance between the exploration and exploitation is found, they can be reliable and efficient global optimizers. Genetic algorithms (GAs) and differential evolution with tabu list (DETL) have been very successful for performing phase equilibrium calculations in non-reactive systems. However, there are no previous studies on the performance of both these strategies to solve the Gibbs free energy minimization problem for systems subject to chemical equilibrium. In this study, the constrained and unconstrained Gibbs free energy minimization in reactive systems have been analyzed and used to assess the performance of GA and DETL. Specifically, the numerical performance of these stochastic methods have been tested using both conventional and transformed composition variables as the decision vector for free energy minimization in reactive systems, and their relative strengths are discussed. The results of these strategies are compared with those obtained using SA, which has shown competitive performance in reactive phase equilibrium calculations. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies in the literature on the comparison of reactive phase equilibrium using both the formulations with stochastic global optimization methods. Our results show that the effectiveness of the stochastic methods tested depends on the stopping criterion, the type of decision variables, and the use of local optimization for intensification stage. Overall, unconstrained Gibbs free energy minimization involving transformed composition variables requires more computational time compared to constrained minimization, and DETL has better performance for both constrained and unconstrained Gibbs free energy minimization in reactive systems.Phase equilibrium modeling plays an important role in design, optimization and control of separation processes.

78,Construction and characterization of BAC libraries from major grapevine cultivars,A. Adam-Blondon;A. Bernole;G. Faes;D. Lamoureux;S. Pateyron;M. Grando;M. Caboche;R. Velasco;B. Chalhoub,Theoretical and Applied Genetics,"Genome projects were initiated on grapevine (Vitis vinifera L., 2n=38, genome size 475 Mb) through the successful construction of four bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries from three major cultivars, Cabernet Sauvignon (Cabernet S), Syrah and two different clones of Pinot Noir (Pinot N). Depending on the library, the genome coverage represented 4.5–14.8 genome equivalents with clones having a mean insert size of 93–158 kb. BAC pools suitable for PCR screening were constructed for two of these BAC libraries [Cabernet S and Pinot N clone (cl) 115] and subsequently used to confirm the genome coverage of both libraries by PCR anchoring of 74 genetic markers sampled from the 19 linkage groups. For ten of these markers, two bands on separate BAC pools were differentiated that could correspond either to different alleles or to a duplication of the locus being studied. Finally, a preliminary assessment of the correspondence between genetic and physical distances was made through the anchoring of all the markers mapped along linkage group 1 of the V. vinifera genetic map. A pair of markers, 2.1 cM apart, anchored the same BAC clones, which allowed us to estimate that 1 cM corresponded in this particular region to a maximum length of 130 kb."

81,Correlates of Initial Recall of a Multimedia Communication Campaign to Promote Physical Activity among Tweens: the WIXX Campaign,A. Bélanger-Gravel;N. Cutumisu;L. Gauvin;F. Lagarde;M. Laferté,Health Communication,"This study examined factors associated with children’s and parents’ recall of a communication campaign aimed at promoting children’s physical activity. A cross-sectional population-based telephone survey was conducted among 1001 children and their parents. Respondents were recruited through a random digit dialing procedure. Respondents’ recall of the campaign, beliefs, sociodemographics as well as levels of physical activity and sedentary behaviors were self-reported. Logistic regression analyses were conducted for tweens and their parents separately. Girls (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1; 95%confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 3.5) were more likely to have unaided recall when compared to boys. Tweens in primary school (OR = 1.9; 95%CI: 1.0, 3.4 and OR = 2.1; 95%CI: 1.4, 3.0) and those speaking French (OR = 3.3; 95%CI: 1.4, 8.1 and OR = 2.9; 95%CI: 1.8, 4.7) were more likely to have unaided and aided recall, respectively. Among parents, tweens’ unaided (OR = 12.0; 95%CI: 5.2, 28.1) and aided (OR = 3.3; 95%CI: 1.5, 7.3) recall, obesity status (OR = 2.6; 95%CI: 1.3, 5.3), and low income (OR = 5.2; 95%CI: 1.9, 14.3) were positively associated with recall. Additional beliefs were associated with tweens’ and parents’ recall of the campaign. The association between sex, language, and recall is in line with the branding strategy adopted and no clear evidence for communication inequalities was observed."
82,Corruption and Software Piracy: A Comparative Perspective,A. Andrés;R. Goel,Policy and Internet,"This article examines the influence of corruption on software piracy across countries. Drawing on a simple theoretical model and a large sample of countries for a recent time period, it addresses three key questions: (i) What are the key determinants of software piracy?; (ii) How do nations with different piracy levels respond differently to factors that affect piracy, especially corruption?; and (iii) Is there a two‐way causality between software piracy and corruption? It is demonstrated that corruption levels help explain variations in software piracy across countries, with higher levels of corruption correlating with higher levels of software piracy. However, the influences of different factors (including democracy, economic prosperity, market size and legal factors as well as corruption) are sensitive to prevailing levels of piracy, varying across countries with different piracy rates. Policy implications are discussed; these findings suggest that anti‐piracy initiatives would need to be fine‐tuned to country context, such as existing piracy levels."

Ruiz-Negrón;J. Powell;L. Tamariz;J. Whittle;J. Wright;M. Supiano;A. Cheung;W. Weintraub;A. Moran,New England Journal of Medicine,"Background In the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease who received intensive systolic blood-pressure control (target, &lt;120 mm Hg) had significantly lower rates of death and cardiovascular disease events than did those who received standard control (target, &lt;140 mm Hg). On the basis of these data, we wanted to determine the lifetime health benefits and health care costs associated with intensive control versus standard control.Methods We used a microsimulation model to apply SPRINT treatment effects and health care costs from national sources to a hypothetical cohort of SPRINT-eligible adults. The model projected lifetime costs of treatment and monitoring in patients with hypertension, cardiovascular disease events and subsequent treatment costs, treatment-related risks of serious adverse events and subsequent costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for intensive control versus standard control of systolic blood pressure.Results We determined that the mean number of QALYs would be 0.27 higher among patients who received intensive control than among those who received standard control and would cost approximately $47,000 more per QALY gained if there were a reduction in adherence and treatment effects after 5 years; the cost would be approximately $28,000 more per QALY gained if the treatment effects persisted for the remaining lifetime of the patient. Most simulation results indicated that intensive treatment would be cost-effective (51 to 79% below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY and 76 to 93% below the threshold of $100,000 per QALY), regardless of whether treatment effects were reduced after 5 years or persisted for the remaining lifetime.Conclusions In this simulation study, intensive systolic blood-pressure control prevented cardiovascular disease events and prolonged life and did so at levels below common willingness-to-pay thresholds per QALY, regardless of whether benefits were reduced after 5 years or persisted for the patient’s remaining lifetime.

84,Creativity and Lawbreaking,A. Cropley;D. Cropley,Creativity Research Journal,"Lawbreaking and creativity are often conceptualized as alternative, almost competing, expressions of the general psychological disposition of deviance. Where the 2 occur together, they are mainly discussed in terms of lawbreaking by acknowledged creative people that is irrelevant to their creativity or is a byproduct of outspoken, reckless, or unbridled creativity. The deliberate application of creativity in the direct service of intentional lawbreaking is rarely discussed, possibly because of the positive connotations associated with creativity. In fact, although psychological studies mainly conceptualize it in terms of deficits, some lawbreaking involves generation of highly effective—even admirable—novelty, and some lawbreakers display psychological characteristics typically associated with creative individuals, so that a deficit model is inappropriate. Creative lawbreakers and law enforcers can be conceptualized as competitors in much the same way as businesses are competitors, and this suggests a fresh way of looking at law enforcement."
85,Creativity and mental health in everyday life,A. Cropley,Creativity Research Journal,"The connection between mental health and creativity has traditionally been studied in terms of outstanding aesthetic‐professional creativity and mental illness. More interesting however, is the possible connection between “everyday “ creativity and mental health. Everyday creativity involves attacking day to day activities in a divergent way: It derives from a complex of cognitive, affective, personal, motivational, and social factors, and is characterized by openness, flexibility, autonomy, playfulness, humor willingness to take risks, and perseverance. These characteristics are also consistently emphasized in models of “normal”; personality growth, so that the possibility of promoting mental health arises by fostering creativity in day to day life. Several small studies described in this article give examples of how this might be done and the kinds of benefits which can result."

Ss characterized by creative achievement in their everyday lives differed from chronic schizophrenics in tolerance for incongruity in information input, with the creatives superior also to normals. Creatives also differed from schizophrenics in complexity, flexibility, and differentiation, but these differences were apparently a characteristic of the schizophrenic process rather than of creativity, since creatives and normals did not differ on these variables. Creativity is interpreted as involving largely affect, schizophrenia as involving both affect and association. (31 ref.)"
87,Critical collapse in the spherically symmetric Einstein-Vlasov model,A. Akbarian;M. Choptuik,Physical Review D,"We solve the coupled Einstein-Vlasov system in spherical symmetry using direct numerical integration of the Vlasov equation in phase space. Focusing on the case of massless particles we study critical phenomena in the model, finding strong evidence for generic type I behavior at the black hole threshold that parallels what has previously been observed in the massive sector. For differing families of initial data we find distinct critical solutions, so there is no universality of the critical configuration itself. However we find indications of at least a weak universality in the lifetime scaling exponent, which is yet to be understood. Additionally, we clarify the role that angular momentum plays in the critical behavior in the massless case."
88,DOUBLE VERSUS SINGLE RENAL ALLOGRAFTS FROM AGED DONORS,A. Andrés;J. Morales;J. Herrero;M. Praga;E. Morales;E. Hernández;T. Ortuño;J. Rodçio;M. Martñez;G. Usera;R. Dáz;G. Polo;F. Aguirre;O. Leiva,Transplantation,"Background.: The age limit of the cadaver kidney donors is increasing in response to the growing demand for renal transplantation. Simultaneous double kidney transplantation (SDKT) with kidneys obtained from elderly adults has been proposed to increase the transplantation number and improve its results. However, if SDKT is performed when there are no clear indications, a negative effect could be produced on the total number of transplanted patients as both kidneys would be used for only one recipient. Material and Methods.: In December 1996 we designed a transplantation protocol to be able to extend the selection of cadaver kidney donors with normal serum creatinine levels without establishing any age limit. A pregraft renal biopsy was always performed to analyze the glomerulosclerosis (GE) percentage whenever the donors were 60 years of age or older. A SDKT was performed in a single recipient when the donor age was 75 years or older or when the donors between 60 and 74 years old had a GE rate of more than 15%. On the contrary, a single kidney transplantation was performed in two different recipients for kidneys from donors between 60 and 74 years of age with a GE rate of less than 15%. Kidneys having GE rates of more than 50% were discarded for transplantation. Donor kidneys from subjects younger than 60 years of age were always used for a single kidney transplantation. Results.: Based on the above mentioned protocol, from December 1996 to May 1998, 181 patients received a kidney transplantation in our hospital. These patients were divided into three groups: group I which included the SDKT recipients (n=21), group II or single kidney recipients from 60- to 74-year-old donors (n=40), and group III or recipients from <60-year-old donors (n=120). The mean follow-up time was 15±5 months (range 6–24). Mean donor age was 75±7 years in group I, this was significantly higher than in group II (67±4, P <0.001) and group III (37±15, P <0.001). The primary nonfunction rate was low in the three groups, there being no statistically significant differences (5, 5, and 4%, respectively). A significantly greater percentage of patients from group I (76%) presented immediate renal graft function as compared with group II (43%, P <0.01) and III (50%, P <0.05). The acute rejections rate was very low in all three groups (9.5, 7.5, and 22%, respectively) with significant differences between groups II and III ( P <0.05). No significant differences between the different groups were observed for one year actuarial patient survival (100, 95, and 98%, respectively) or graft survival rates (95, 90, and 93%, respectively). The 6-month serum creatinine levels were excellent in the three groups, although there were significant differences between groups I and II (1.6±0.3 vs. 1.9±0.6 mg/dl, P <0.05), II and III (1.9±0.6 vs. 1.4±0.4 mg/dl, P <0.001), and I and III ( P <0.05). Conclusions.: Simultaneous double kidney transplantations make it possible to use kidneys from extremely elderly donors (>75 years) or those whose GE>15%. In addition, kidneys from donor 60–74 years old in which the GE<15% can be used for single kidney transplantations in two different recipients with excellent results."
89,Decomposition of polynomials and approximate roots,A. Bodin,Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society,"We state a kind of Euclidian division theorem: given a polynomial $ P(x)$ and a divisor $ d$ of the degree of $ P$ , there exist polynomials $ h(x),Q(x),R(x)$ such that $ P(x) = h\circ Q(x) +R(x)$ , with $ \deg h=d$ . Under some conditions $ h,Q,R$ are unique, and $ Q$ is the approximate $ d$ -root of $ P$ . Moreover we give an algorithm to compute such a decomposition. We apply these results to decide whether a polynomial in one or several variables is decomposable or not."
90,Deep eutectic solvents based on N-methylacetamide and a lithium salt as suitable electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries,A. Boisset;S. Menne;J. Jacquemin;A. Balducci;M. Anouti,Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,"In this work, we present a study on the physical and electrochemical properties of three new Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) based on N-methylacetamide (MAc) and a lithium salt (LiX, with X = bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide, TFSI; hexafluorophosphate, PF6; or nitrate, NO3). Based on DSC measurements, it appears that these systems are liquid at room temperature for a lithium salt mole fraction ranging from 0.10 to 0.35. The temperature dependences of the ionic conductivity and the viscosity of these DESs are correctly described by using the Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher (VTF) type fitting equation, due to the strong interactions between Li+, X− and MAc in solution. Furthermore, these electrolytes possess quite large electrochemical stability windows up to 4.7–5 V on Pt, and demonstrate also a passivating behavior toward the aluminum collector at room temperature. Based on these interesting electrochemical properties, these selected DESs can be classified as potential and promising electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). For this purpose, a test cell was then constructed and tested at 25 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C by using each selected DES as an electrolyte and LiFePO4 (LFP) material as a cathode. The results show a good compatibility between each DES and LFP electrode material. A capacity of up to 160 mA h g−1 with a good efficiency (99%) is observed in the DES based on the LiNO3 salt at 60 °C despite the presence of residual water in the electrolyte. Finally preliminary tests using a LFP/DES/LTO (lithium titanate) full cell at room temperature clearly show that LiTFSI-based DES can be successfully introduced into LIBs. Considering the beneficial properties, especially, the cost of these electrolytes, such introduction could represent an important contribution for the realization of safer and environmentally friendly LIBs."
91,Delta: A new measure of agreement between two raters,A. Andrés;P. Marzo,British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology,"The most common measure of agreement for categorical data is the coefficient kappa. However, kappa performs poorly when the marginal distributions are very asymmetric, it is not easy to interpret, and its definition is based on hypothesis of independence of the responses (which is more restrictive than the hypothesis that kappa has a value of zero). This paper defines a new measure of agreement, delta, ‘the proportion of agreements that are not due to chance’, which comes from model of multiple‐choice tests and does not have the previous limitations. The paper shows that kappa and delta generally take very similar values, except when the marginal distributions are strongly unbalanced. The case of the 2 × 2 tables (which admits very simple solutions) is considered in detail."
92,Design and construction of African swine fever virus chimeras incorporating foreign viral epitopes,A. Brun;F. Rodríguez;F. Parra;F. Sobrino;J. Escribano,Archives of Virology,"In the present work we have studied the feasibility of introducing foreign epitopes into the African swine fever virus (ASFV) particle by genetic manipulation of the virus. For this purpose, we developed specific transfer vectors containing the gene encoding for the highly antigenic structural ASFV protein p54 in which foreign sequences were introduced. DNA sequences encoding continuous linear epitopes, the antigenic site A from foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) VP1 protein and the DAff3 antigenic determinant from transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) nucleoprotein N, were separately cloned into the p54 gene, in a region encoding a non-essential domain of the protein. Chimeric p54 genes were inserted by homologous recombination into the thymidine kinase (TK) locus of ASFV genome. The resulting recombinant viruses efficiently expressed both chimeric proteins under transcriptional control of the p54 promoter, and the chimeric gene products were recognized by antibodies to both p54 and foreign epitopes. The modified p54 proteins were also found in the viral particles and complemented the function of the wild-type p54, since deletion of the p54 gene from recombinant viruses did not affected virus replication in Vero cells. This work demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of incorporating foreign amino acid sequences (up to 18 residues) into a protein component of the ASFV particle without affecting virus viability."
93,Detecting Anomalous Faces with 'No Peeking' Autoencoders,A. Bhattad;J. Rock;D. Forsyth,ArXiv Computer Science,"Detecting anomalous faces has important applications. For example, a system might tell when a train driver is incapacitated by a medical event, and assist in adopting a safe recovery strategy. These applications are demanding, because they require accurate detection of rare anomalies that may be seen only at runtime. Such a setting causes supervised methods to perform poorly. We describe a method for detecting an anomalous face image that meets these requirements. We construct a feature vector that reliably has large entries for anomalous images, then use various simple unsupervised methods to score the image based on the feature. Obvious constructions (autoencoder codes; autoencoder residuals) are defeated by a 'peeking' behavior in autoencoders. Our feature construction removes rectangular patches from the image, predicts the likely content of the patch conditioned on the rest of the image using a specially trained autoencoder, then compares the result to the image. High scores suggest that the patch was difficult for an autoencoder to predict, and so is likely anomalous. We demonstrate that our method can identify real anomalous face images in pools of typical images, taken from celeb-A, that is much larger than usual in state-of-the-art experiments. A control experiment based on our method with another set of normal celebrity images - a 'typical set', but nonceleb-A are not identified as anomalous; confirms this is not due to special properties of celeb-A."
94,Detecting Permanent and Intermittent Purchase Hotspots via Computational Stigmergy,A. Alfeo;M. Cimino;B. Lepri;A. Pentland;G. Vaglini,ArXiv Computer Science,"The analysis of credit card transactions allows gaining new insights into the spending occurrences and mobility behavior of large numbers of individuals at an unprecedented scale. However, unfolding such spatiotemporal patterns at a community level implies a non-trivial system modeling and parametrization, as well as, a proper representation of the temporal dynamic. In this work we address both those issues by means of a novel computational technique, i.e. computational stigmergy. By using computational stigmergy each sample position is associated with a digital pheromone deposit, which aggregates with other deposits according to their spatiotemporal proximity. By processing transactions data with computational stigmergy, it is possible to identify high-density areas (hotspots) occurring in different time and days, as well as, analyze their consistency over time. Indeed, a hotspot can be permanent, i.e. present throughout the period of observation, or intermittent, i.e. present only in certain time and days due to community level occurrences (e.g. nightlife). Such difference is not only spatial (where the hotspot occurs) and temporal (when the hotspot occurs) but affects also which people visit the hotspot. The proposed approach is tested on a real-world dataset containing the credit card transaction of 60k users between 2014 and 2015."
95,Detection of charcoal rot (Macrophomina phaseolina) toxin effects in soybean (Glycine max) seedlings using hyperspectral spectroscopy,A. Al-Ahmadi;A. Subedi;G. Wang;R. Choudhary;D. Watson,Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,"Charcoal rot caused by the fungal pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina is an important disease of soybean and the use of resistant cultivars is recommended to manage the disease. Since symptoms, including leaf wilt, typically occur as soybeans reach maturity, screening varieties for tolerance to charcoal rot can be time-consuming, requiring nearly an entire growing season. In this study, soybean seedlings (V1) were exposed to a culture filtrate of M. phaseolina containing toxin(s) produced by the fungal pathogen. The effect on the seedlings was measured with hyperspectral spectroscopy on leaves. Two spectrometers integrated with a fiber optic light source and a 6.35 mm diameter probe yielding 480–850 nm and 900–2400 nm ranges after preprocessing were used. The spectra of the untreated plants measured at 0 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h post-exposure to the fungal extract were nearly indistinguishable. In contrast, the toxin-treated plants had significantly different spectra from the untreated plants at each of the 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h measurements. Reflectance increased in the NIR (900–2400 nm) region with extended exposure to the fungal extract. This change was most noticeable in the 1450 nm and 1940 nm wavebands. Across the spectra, the 24 h reflectance was significantly higher than that of 12 h, which was significantly higher than those of 8 h, 4 h, and 0 h. Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance, quantifying class separability, was used as a feature selection method and the 24 h measurement had the highest JM distance values, which indicated good separability. Based on JM Distance the most sensitive wavebands were in the regions of 1370–2400 nm. A ratio of the reflectance at 0 h to reflectance at the other times for each of the wavebands was calculated. The ratio curves had two noticeable troughs centered on 1450 nm and 1940 nm, with respective ratios of 0.47 and 0.32 for the 24 h measurement. The 1940 nm ratio at 24 h was proposed as a relative measure of charcoal rot susceptibility of soybean varieties. A ratio of 1.0 indicated no susceptibility with lower ratios indicating greater susceptibility to charcoal rot toxin(s). This study has implications in terms of developing tools to screen for soybean varieties tolerant to charcoal rot and potentially for other biotic or abiotic factors that induce foliar wilting."
96,Deterioration and recovery of FRC after high temperature exposure,A. Akca;N. Özyurt,Cement and Concrete Composites,"In general, physical properties of concrete deteriorate after high temperature exposure and this is a result of some morphological changes occur in microstructure of concrete. After heating some new phases occur in concrete and these have a tendency to react with water and carbon dioxide at the post heating stage. The most common one is expansive rehydration of CaO by turning into Ca(OH)2 and this reaction should be avoided for concrete of which mechanical properties deteriorated after heating. Since, Ca(OH)2 is a soluble product in water, water re-curing after high temperature exposure can be beneficial. Also using steel fibers in concrete may be useful to restrain the stresses occurred due to this expansion and polypropylene fibers can be used to reduce the pore pressure in concrete during heating. Therefore, 8 groups of 0.45 w/c ratio of concrete were produced by using different fibers and air entraining admixture. Cubic concrete specimens (15 cm on a side) were cast and only one face of the specimens was subjected to 1000 °C. K-Type thermocouples were placed in concrete specimens to monitor temperature change during heating. Two re-curing methods, air and water, were applied to specimens following the cooling period. SEM, EDX, XRD and TGA investigations were conducted to evaluate the morphological changes in concrete. Then effects of these changes on the residual mechanical properties of concretes were evaluated.In general, physical properties of concrete deteriorate after high temperature exposure and this is a result of some morphological changes occur in microstructure of concrete.

97,Determinants of suicides in Denmark: Evidence from time series data,A. Andrés;F. Halicioglu,Health Policy,"This research examines empirically the determinants of suicides in Denmark over the period 1970–2006. To our knowledge, there exist no previous study that estimates a dynamic econometric model of suicides on the basis of time series data and cointegration framework at disaggregate level. Our results indicate that suicide is associated with a range of socio-economic factors but the strength of the association can differ by gender. In particular, we find that a rise in real per capita income and fertility rate decreases suicides for males and females. Divorce is positively associated with suicides and this effect seems to be stronger for men. A fall in unemployment rates seems to lower significantly suicides in males and females. Policy implications of suicides are discussed with some appropriate recommendations."
98,Determination and Assessment of Optimum Internal Thermal Insulation for Masonry Walls in Historic Multifamily Buildings,A. Amirzadeh;R. Strand;R. Hammann;M. Bhandari,Journal of Architectural Engineering,"A large portion of existing building stock is comprised of load-bearing masonry buildings, particularly in the Midwest and on the East Coast, though such buildings are distributed across the US. Most of them have uninsulated walls or suffer from insufficient thermal insulation materials. These buildings are inseparable parts of the cultural, social, and economic characteristics of their cities. Due to heritage and preservation concerns, zoning, and space restrictions, they cannot be retrofitted with exterior insulation. Interior insulation must therefore be considered as an alternative. Lack of insulation directly results in energy waste as well as heat loss and gain. Furthermore, it adversely affects heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads, equipment sizing, indoor air quality, and thermal comfort for residents. The objective of this study is to simulate and evaluate the effects of various internal thermal insulation materials and strategies on mass masonry load-bearing walls in multifamily buildings with attention to various variables and parameters. It not only addresses the energy performance and cost savings associated with an interior insulation retrofit, but also outlines other variables and parameters that are factors in the selection of optimum insulation material, including installations costs, payback periods, useful internal space loss, and options for the depth of the interior insulation retrofit. The audience for this paper is diverse: homeowners, contractors and remodelers, architects and designers, engineers, housing and preservation authorities, and more can benefit from understanding the results outlined in this study."

100,Determination of antioxidant additives in foodstuffs by direct measurement of gold nanoparticle formation using resonance light scattering detection,A. Andreu-Navarro;J. Fernández-Romero;A. Gómez-Hens,Analytica Chimica Acta,"The capability of antioxidant compounds to reduce gold(III) to gold nanoparticles has been kinetically studied in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide using stopped-flow mixing technique and resonance light scattering as detection system. This study has given rise to a simple and rapid method for the determination of several synthetic and natural antioxidants used as additives in foodstuff samples. The formation of AuNPs was monitored by measuring the initial reaction-rate of the system in about 5 s, using an integration time of 0.1 s. Dynamic ranges of the calibration graphs and detection limits, obtained with standard solutions of the analytes, were (μmol L−1): gallic acid (0.04–0.59, 0.01), propyl gallate (0.04–1.41, 0.01), octyl gallate (0.03–0.35, 0.08), dodecyl gallate (0.02–0.30, 0.007), butylated hydroxyanisol (0.07–0.39, 0.009), butylated hydroxytoluene (0.04–0.32, 0.01), ascorbic acid (0.11–1.72, 0.03) and sodium citrate (0.07–1.29, 0.02). The regression coefficients were higher than 0.994 in all instances. The precision of the method, expressed as RSD%, was established at two concentration levels of each analyte, with values ranging between 0.6 and 4.8%. The practical usefulness of the developed method was demonstrated by the determination of several antioxidant additives in foodstuff samples, which were extracted, appropriately diluted and assayed, obtaining recoveries between 95.4 and 99.5%. The results obtained were validated using two reference methods."
101,Determination of monoamine neurotransmitters in zebrafish (Danio rerio) by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with a two-step derivatization,A. Aragon;J. Legradi;A. Ballesteros-Gómez;J. Legler;M. Velzen;J. Boer;P. Leonards,Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry,"A sensitive analytical method for the determination of monoamine neurotransmitters (MNTs) in zebrafish larvae was developed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Six MNTs were selected as target compounds for neurotoxicity testing. MNTs underwent a two-step derivatization with hexamethyldisilazane (HDMS) for O-silylation followed by N-methyl-bis-heptafluorobutyramide (MBHFBA) for N-perfluoroacylation. Derivatization conditions were optimized by an experimental design approach. Method validation showed linear calibration curves (r 2 &gt; 0.9976) in the range of 1–100 ng for all the compounds. The recovery rates were between 92 and 119%. The method was repeatable and reproducible with relative standard deviations (RSD) in the range of 2.5–9.3% for intra-day and 4.8–12% for inter-day variation. The limits of detection and the limits of quantitation were 0.4–0.8 and 1.2–2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The method was successfully applied to detect and quantify trace levels of MNTs in 5-day-old zebrafish larvae that were exposed to low concentrations of neurotoxic chemicals such as pesticides and methylmercury. Although visual malformations were not detected, the MNT levels varied significantly during early zebrafish development. These results show that exposure to neurotoxic chemicals can alter neurotransmitter levels and thereby may influence early brain development."
102,Determination of nanostructures and drug distribution in lipid nanoparticles by single molecule microscopy,A. Boreham;P. Volz;D. Peters;C. Keck;U. Alexiev,European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics,"Drug loading capacity in nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) depends on the formation of nanostructures within the lipid matrix. However, investigation of these nanostructures with sizes below the diffraction limit of visible light is quite challenging. Thus, until now the determination of structures and drug distribution within NLCs was not possible. Therefore, we aimed at developing a method to visualize the nanostructures within the lipid carriers. Model NLCs loaded with a lipophilic fluorescent drug mimetic, ATTO-Oxa12, were produced and investigated by single-molecule tracking and localization-based superresolution microscopy. Results revealed spherical ATTO-Oxa12-filled nanostructures with diameters of ∼70 nm and 120–130 nm, both smaller than the NLC size (∼160 nm). The ATTO-Oxa12 diffusion constant was calculated from the single-molecule traces (D ⩾ 1 μm2/s) and indicated the distribution of the model drug in the oily component. Together these data suggest the existence of drug-loaded oily nanocompartments, which could fill up to ∼50% of the model NLCs’ volume. In conclusion, a novel tool based on single-molecule microscopy is now available that allows for the precise determination of drug distribution and the characterization of lipid nanostructures, information that is paramount for optimizing lipid nanoparticle formulations."
103,"Determination of polyphenolic content in beverages using laccase, gold nanoparticles and long wavelength fluorimetry",A. Andreu-Navarro;J. Fernández-Romero;A. Gómez-Hens,Analytica Chimica Acta,"An enzymatic fluorimetric method for the determination of polyphenol compounds in beverages is described, which is based on the temporal inhibition caused by these compounds on the oxidation of the long wavelength fluorophor indocyanine green (λex 764 nm, λem 806 nm), in the presence of the enzyme laccase and positively charged gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The oxidation of the dye gives rise to a fast decrease in its fluorescence, but it is delayed by the polyphenol, obtaining a time period directly proportional to its concentration, which has been used as the analytical parameter. The behaviour of several benzenediols and benzenetriols in the system and the modification of the activity of the enzyme by its interaction with AuNPs have been studied.The system has been optimized using gallic acid as a polyphenol model, but the dynamic ranges of the calibration graphs and the detection limits for several of the polyphenols assayed were obtained (μmol L−1): gallic acid (0.13–5, 0.04), catechol (0.08–5, 0.01), hydroquinone (0.05–2, 0.01), hydroxyhydroquinone (0.09–5, 0.03), pyrogallol (0.17–5, 0.04). Most of the values of the regression coefficients were 0.999 and the precision of the method, expressed as RSD% and checked at two concentration levels of each analyte, ranged between 1.8 and 5.6%. The method has been applied to the determination of polyphenol content in several foodstuff samples and the results compared with those obtained with the standard Folin–Ciocalteu method."
104,Determination of protein‐only RNase P interactome in Arabidopsis mitochondria and chloroplasts identifies a complex between PRORP1 and another NYN domain nuclease,A. Bouchoucha;F. Waltz;G. Bonnard;M. Arrivé;P. Hammann;L. Kuhn;C. Schelcher;H. Zuber;A. Gobert;P. Giegé,Plant Journal,"The essential endonuclease activity that removes 5' leader sequences from transfer RNA precursors is called RNase P. While ribonucleoprotein RNase P enzymes containing a ribozyme are found in all domains of life, another type of RNase P called “PRORP”, for “PROtein‐only RNase P”, only composed of protein occurs in a wide variety of eukaryotes, in organelles and the nucleus. Here, in order to find how PRORP functions integrate with other cell processes, we exemplarily explore the protein interaction network of PRORP1 in Arabidopsis mitochondria and chloroplasts. Although PRORP proteins function as single subunit enzymes in vitro, we find that PRORP1 occurs in protein complexes and is present in high molecular weight fractions containing mitochondrial ribosomes. The analysis of immuno‐precipitated protein complexes identifies proteins involved in organellar gene expression processes. In particular, direct interaction is established between PRORP1 and MNU2 a mitochondrial nuclease. A specific domain of MNU2 and a conserved signature of PRORP1 are found to be directly accountable for this protein interaction. Altogether, results reveal the existence of an RNA maturation complex in Arabidopsis mitochondria and suggest that PRORP proteins cooperate with other gene expression factors for RNA maturation in vivo.

105,Determination of rapid Deccan eruptions across the Cretaceous‐Tertiary boundary using paleomagnetic secular variation: 2. Constraints from analysis of eight new sections and synthesis for a 3500‐m‐thick composite section,A. Chenet;V. Courtillot;F. Fluteau;M. Gérard;X. Quidelleur;S. Khadri;K. Subbarao;T. Thordarson,Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth,"[1] The present paper completes a restudy of the main lava pile in the Deccan flood basalt province (trap) of India. Chenet et al. (2008) reported results from the upper third, and this paper reports the lower two thirds of the 3500‐m‐thick composite section. The methods employed are the same, i.e., combined use of petrology, volcanology, chemostratigraphy, morphology, K‐Ar absolute dating, study of sedimentary alteration horizons, and as the main correlation tool, analysis of detailed paleomagnetic remanence directions. The thickness and volume of the flood basalt province studied in this way are therefore tripled. A total of 169 sites from eight new sections are reported in this paper. Together with the results of Chenet et al. (2008), these data represent in total 70% of the 3500‐m combined section of the main Deccan traps province. This lava pile was erupted in some 30 major eruptive periods or single eruptive events (SEE), each with volumes ranging from 1000 to 20,000 km3 and 41 individual lava units with a typical volume of 1300 km3. Paleomagnetic analysis shows that some SEEs with thicknesses attaining 200 m were emplaced over distances in excess of 100 km (both likely underestimates, due to outcrop conditions) and up to 800 km. The total time of emission of all combined SEEs could have been (much) less than 10 ka, with most of the time recorded in a very small number of intervening alteration levels marking periods of volcanic quiescence (so‐called “big red boles”). The number of boles, thickness of the pulses, and morphology of the traps suggest that eruptive fluxes and volumes were larger in the older formations and slowed down with more and longer quiescence periods in the end. On the basis of geochronologic results published by Chenet et al. (2007) and paleontological results from Keller et al. (2008), we propose that volcanism occurred in three rather short, discrete phases or megapulses, an early one at ∼67.5 ± 1 Ma near the C30r/C30n transition and the two largest around 65 ± 1 Ma, one entirely within C29r just before the K‐T boundary, the other shortly afterward spanning the C29r/C29n reversal. We next estimate sulfur dioxide (likely a major agent of environmental stress) amounts and fluxes released by SEEs: they would have ranged from 5 to 100 Gt and 0.1 to 1 Gt/a, respectively, over durations possibly as short as 100 years for each SEE. The chemical input of the Chicxulub impact would have been on the same order as that of a very large single pulse. The impact, therefore, appears as important but incremental, neither the sole nor main cause of the Cretaceous‐Tertiary mass extinctions."

Chenet;F. Fluteau;V. Courtillot;M. Gérard;K. Subbarao,Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth,"[1] Flow‐by‐flow reanalysis of paleomagnetic directions in two sections of the Mahabaleshwar escarpment, coupled with analysis of intertrappean alteration levels shows that volcanism spanned a much shorter time than previously realized. The sections comprise the upper part of magnetic chron C29r, transitional directions and the lowermost part of C29n. Lack of paleosecular variation allows identification of four directional groups, implying very large (40 to 180 m thick) single eruptive events (SEEs) having occurred in a few decades. Paleomagnetism allows temporal constraints upon the formation of 9 out of 23 thin red bole levels found in the sections to no more than a few decades; the two thickest altered layers could have formed in 1 to 50 ka. The typical volumes of SEEs (corresponding to magnetic directional groups) are estimated at 3000 to 20,000 km3, with flux rates ∼100 km3 a−1, having lasted for decades. Flood basalt emission can be translated into SO2 injection rates of several Gt a−1, which could have been the main agent of environmental change. The total volume of SO2 emitted by the larger SEEs could be on the order of that released by the Chicxulub impact. Moreover, each SEE may have injected 10 to 100 times more SO2 in the atmosphere than the deleterious 1783 Laki eruption. The detailed time sequence of SEEs appears to be the key feature having controlled the extent of climate change. If several SEEs erupted in a short sequence (compared to the equilibration time of the ocean), they could have generated a runaway effect leading to mass extinction."
107,Determination of reaction forces of a deck crane in wave motion using screw theory,A. Cibicik;G. Tysse;O. Egeland,Journal of Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering,"In this paper, we present a method for calculating reaction forces for a crane mounted on a ship moving in waves. The method is used to calculate the reaction forces between the crane base and the vessel deck. This includes the case where the crane is mounted on the platform that keeps the base of the crane horizontal when the vessel is moving in roll and pitch. The wave motion of the ship is modeled with force response amplitude operators (RAOs) based on the JONSWAP wave spectrum. The combined equations of motion for a vessel and a crane are derived using Kane’s equations of motion, where velocities and angular velocities are formulated in terms of twists, and the associated partial velocities and partial angular velocities are given as lines in Plücker coordinates. The unknown reaction forces are represented as wrenches and are determined using screw transformations. The method is used to study the effect of the roll and pitch compensation platform in numerical simulations. The efficiency of the platform is evaluated in terms of the magnitude of reaction forces and crane payload sway angles."
108,Determination of the Superconductor-Insulator Phase Diagram for One-Dimensional Wires,A. Bollinger;R. Dinsmore;A. Rogachev;A. Bezryadin,Physical Review Letters,"We establish the superconductor-insulator phase diagram for quasi-one-dimensional wires by measuring a large set of MoGe nanowires. This diagram is roughly consistent with the Chakravarty-Schmid-Bulgadaev phase boundary, namely, with the critical resistance being equal to RQ=h/4e2. Deviations from this boundary for a small fraction of the samples prompt us to suggest an alternative phase diagram, which matches the data exactly. Transport properties of wires in the superconducting phase are dominated by phase slips, whereas insulating nanowires exhibit a weak Coulomb blockade behavior."
109,Determination of the transport parameters of nanocrystalline CdSe:Cu thin films,A. Al-Kabbi;K. Sharma;G. Saini;S. Tripathi,Physica Scripta,"Thin films of copper (Cu)-doped CdSe are prepared by the physical vapor deposition technique. X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the films crystallize in hexagonal structure with (100) as the preferred orientation. Scanning electron microscope studies reveal that the grains are spherical in shape and uniformly distributed all over the surface of the substrates. The transport properties of Cu-doped CdSe thin films have been investigated by the time-of-flight measurement, steady-state photocarrier grating and steady-state photoconductivity techniques. The temperature dependence of dark conductivity and photoconductivity data reflects the existence of two independent donor energy levels. The bimolecular recombination nature of the thin films has been found from the photocurrent-illumination dependence at different applied voltages. The minority carrier diffusion length (Ldiff) is obtained both from the best fit of the experimental photocurrent ratio β versus grating period (Λ) and from the 'Balberg plot'. A straight line has been obtained from the best fit, which confirms that the measured length is the ambipolar diffusion length."
110,Developing a Nonstationary Computational Framework With Application to Modeling Dynamic Modulations in Neural Spiking Responses,A. Akbarian;K. Niknam;M. Parsa;K. Clark;B. Noudoost;N. Nategh,IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering,"Objective: This paper aims to develop a computational model that incorporates the functional effects of modulatory covariates (such as context, task, or behavior), which dynamically alter the relationship between the stimulus and the neural response. Methods: We develop a general computational approach along with an efficient estimation procedure in the widely used generalized linear model (GLM) framework to characterize such nonstationary dynamics in spiking response and spatiotemporal characteristics of a neuron at the level of individual trials. The model employs a set of modulatory components, which nonlinearly interact with other stimulus-related signals to reproduce such nonstationary effects. Results: The model is tested for its ability to predict the responses of neurons in the middle temporal cortex of macaque monkeys during an eye movement task. The fitted model proves successful in capturing the fast temporal modulations in the response, reproducing the spike response temporal statistics, and accurately accounting for the neurons' dynamic spatiotemporal sensitivities, during eye movements. Conclusion: The nonstationary GLM framework developed in this study can be used in cases where a time-varying behavioral or cognitive component makes GLM-based models insufficient to describe the dependencies of neural responses on the stimulus-related covariates. Significance: In addition to being quite powerful in encoding time-varying response modulations, this general framework also enables a readout of the neural code while dissociating the influence of other nonstimulus covariates. This framework will advance our ability to understand sensory processing in higher brain areas when modulated by several behavioral or cognitive variables."
111,Developing new enrichment functions for crack simulation in orthotropic media by the extended finite element method,A. Asadpoure;S. Mohammadi,International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering,"New enrichment functions are proposed for crack modelling in orthotropic media using the extended finite element method (XFEM). In this method, Heaviside and near‐tip functions are utilized in the framework of the partition of unity method for modelling discontinuities in the classical finite element method. In this procedure, by using meshless based ideas, elements containing a crack are not required to conform to crack edges. Therefore, mesh generation is directly performed ignoring the existence of any crack while the method remains capable of extending the crack without any remeshing requirement. Furthermore, the type of elements around the crack‐tip remains the same as other parts of the finite element model and the number of nodes and consequently degrees of freedom are reduced considerably in comparison to the classical finite element method. Mixed‐mode stress intensity factors (SIFs) are evaluated to determine the fracture properties of domain and to compare the proposed approach with other available methods. In this paper, the interaction integral (M‐integral) is adopted, which is considered as one of the most accurate numerical methods for calculating stress intensity factors.

Hamaker,Food Research International,"A novel ingredient acting as a slow digestible dietary fiber (DF) was developed by including native corn starch in calcium alginate microspheres (MS). In this study three types of antioxidant DF-rich ingredients were designed and developed by including in the MS, polyphenol-rich vegetable by-product extracts (obtained from pomegranate peels, olive leaves and artichoke leaves) and their potential functionality was assessed in vitro.Specifically, the physico-chemical properties of the new MS were compared with those of six commercially available DF concentrates and with wheat and oat brans. To evaluate the potential efficacy to release PPs along the gastrointestinal tract (GiT), pomegranate peels-microspheres (PPe-MS) were subjected to in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Results showed that the newly developed MS had higher free antioxidant capacity (free-TAC) than commercial DF rich products, and the bound antioxidant capacity (bound-TAC) of PPe-MS was comparable to that of wheat bran and 4.4 folds higher than that of oat-bran. Furthermore, it was shown that the release of ellagitannins from cooked PPe-MS along in vitro simulated gastro-intestinal digestion decreased from the salivary to the small intestine phase whereas gallic acid, ellagic acid and its derivatives had an opposite trend. A certain amount of PPs was found in the spent pellet obtained from the in vitro digestion, which was mimicking the residue reaching the colon in vivo.

113,Development and testing of a laser-based decontamination system,A. Anthofer;W. Lippmann;A. Hurtado,Optics and Laser Technology,"Decontamination of radioactive concrete surfaces may be necessary during operation or decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Usually only the upper layers of the concrete structure are contaminated and are removed using labor-intensive mechanical milling processes. Production of a large amount of dust, which can lead to secondary contamination, is inherent to these processes. Improvements in high-energy laser technology have now made it possible for laser radiation to be used in decontamination technologies for the removal of concrete layers. A decontamination unit comprising a diode laser with a beam power of 10 kW in continuous wave (CW) mode in combination with an autonomous manipulator was developed for use in nuclear plants. The laser beam melts the concrete surface to a depth of approximately 5 mm. Compressed air jets then detach the molten layer from the concrete surface and convey it to a suction system, with which it is transported to a collection container. Most of the radionuclides are trapped in the solidifying melt particles, which form an extremely stable effluent well suited to long-term storage. A relatively small amount of dust is generated in the process. Because there is no backlash during energy transfer, the laser device carrier can be designed to be lightweight and flexible. A specially developed manipulator that can move freely along walls and ceilings by means of suction plates is used for the carrier unit. This results in short setup times for preparing for use of the device and minimal personnel exposure to the radiation. Experiments were conducted on a concrete wall to demonstrate the functionality of the overall system in realistic conditions. An optimal ablation rate of 2.16 m²/h at an ablation depth of 1–5 mm was achieved. Today’s commercially available diode lasers with powers higher than 50 kW enable ablation rates of &gt;10 m²/h to be achieved and hence make these laser-based systems competitive alternatives to mechanical systems.Decontamination of radioactive concrete surfaces may be necessary during operation or decommissioning of nuclear power plants.

114,"Development and testing of three hybrid methods for the assessment of aquifer vulnerability to nitrates, based on the drastic model, an example from NE Korinthia, Greece",A. Antonakos;N. Lambrakis,Journal of Hydrology,"The assessment of groundwater vulnerability to pollution has proved to be an effective tool for the delineation of protection zones in areas affected by groundwater contamination due to the intensive fertilizer applications. The main objective of this study has been to develop and check the results of three hybrid methods for specific aquifer vulnerability assessment based upon the parameters, classification and rating principles of the well known DRASTIC model. The first method, proposed by [Panagopoulos, G., Antonakos, A., Lambrakis, N., 2006. Optimization of DRASTIC model for groundwater vulnerability assessment, by the use of simple statistical methods and GIS. Hydrogeology Journal (published online).], has proved to be an effective way to modify the DRASTIC model in order to achieve better correlation with actual nitrates occurrence. Descriptive statistics and simple statistical tests on a hydrochemical dataset are used by the method in order to change the initial factor ratings and factor weights participating in the vulnerability assessment equation. The other two methods were developed by the use of logistic regression and weights of evidence statistical procedures and the use of the same hydrochemical dataset, and attain relatively high correlation factors when referring to sample points while correlation was significantly lower for the entire distributions of vulnerability estimation and actual nitrates occurrence."
115,Development of CO2 liquefaction cycles for CO2 sequestration,A. Alabdulkarem;Y. Hwang;R. Radermacher,Applied Thermal Engineering,"CO2 pressurization is a necessary component in any CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS) where enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is to be applied. The power demand for the CO2 pressurization process consumes about 4% from the power plant net power.In this paper, several CO2 pressurization methods, such as compression or liquefaction and pumping using an open cycle or closed cycles, were explored and evaluated. New CO2 liquefaction cycles based on single refrigerant and cascade refrigerants were developed and modeled using HYSYS software. The models were validated against experimental data and/or verified against other simulation software. The liquefaction parameters were optimized for minimum overall power consumption. The considered refrigerants for CO2 liquefaction are NH3, CO2, C3H8 and R134a. One of the developed liquefaction cycles that liquefies the CO2 at 50 bar using NH3 refrigerant resulted in 5.1% less power consumption than the conventional multi-stage compression cycle as well as 27.7% less power consumption than the open CO2 liquefaction cycle."

This paper describes the urgency for a source of education for sustainable development, particularly in the Malaysian business context. The justifications and rationale for incorporating sustainability issues in postgraduate business education is also described in this paper. Additionally, the process involved in developing the programme is also explained. This is the first programme of its kind in Malaysia. USM, which aims to be a sustainability led university, has introduced many significant changes. One of the significant initiatives is to develop an MBA programme that specialises in sustainable development. This programme aims to be the catalyst for changes to sustainability from the business context. The whole process appeared to gain support from the University community with less bureaucratic challenges than were anticipated. This paper provides various examples and ideas for others on how to promote sustainable development for the business community, with a focus on the contribution that can be made by a University.

118,Development of Nusselt number and friction factor correlations for the shell side of spiral-wound heat exchangers,A. Abolmaali;H. Afshin,International Journal of Thermal Sciences,"This research aims to investigate the thermo-hydraulic characteristics of flow in the shell side of spiral-wound heat exchangers with consistent shell geometry. To achieve this end, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics is employed. Geometrical configuration of spiral-wound heat exchangers can be completely determined by knowing six primary parameters including start factor, tube outside diameter, number of tubes in the first layer, number of layers, longitudinal pitch, and radial pitch. Dividing the longitudinal and radial pitches by tube outside diameter, the six primary geometrical parameters reduce to five non-dimensional parameters. The effects of number of tubes in the first layer, number of layers, longitudinal pitch to tube outside diameter ratio, and radial pitch to tube outside diameter ratio referred to as four main non-dimensional parameters on flow and heat transfer are numerically studied by modeling 64 different geometries. The results indicate that the number of tubes in the first layer is the only parameter among four main non-dimensional parameters that does not have any influence on the flow characteristics. Based on the numerical simulation results, multivariate correlations for average Nusselt number and friction factor have been developed taking into account the three remaining main non-dimensional parameters, i.e. the number of layers, the longitudinal pitch to tube outside diameter ratio, and the radial pitch to tube outside diameter ratio. The average deviation of developed Nusselt number and friction factor correlations from numerical simulation results are 5.4% and 7.0%, respectively."
119,Development of a Comprehensive Microkinetic Model for Rh(bis(diazaphospholane))-Catalyzed Hydroformylation,A. Brezny;C. Landis,ACS Catalysis,"Asymmetric hydroformylation (AHF) of alkenes is a prototypical, complicated catalytic transformation with a mechanism that comprises three concurrent, isomeric catalytic cycles. A persistent challenge to understanding such complex systems concerns efficient development of quantitative kinetic models. In this work, we demonstrate development of a comprehensive, empirical microkinetic model of AHF. Central to these studies is exploitation of the information-rich, operando Wisconsin High-Pressure NMR Reactor to collect data for a variety of noncatalytic transformations that focus on different regions of the overall catalytic cycle. Kinetic analysis of these transformations leads to kinetic models for segments of the full cycle; we call these “mini-models.” According to a divide-and-conquer strategy, these individual “mini-models” are combined to build up the full microkinetic catalytic model. This comprehensive model fits all noncatalytic and catalytic data simultaneously, and enables detailed examination of the steps controlling reaction rate, regioselectivity, and enantioselectivity. Scaled sensitivity analysis indicates that, even under catalytic conditions with different resting states, just a few steps impart the largest degree of rate control. In comparison with a simple pedagogical model, we quantitatively demonstrate that we cannot assume the catalyst resting state immediately precedes the turnover-limiting step in mechanisms that include off-cycle catalyst species. These models conclusively demonstrate that even when most of the catalyst lies off-cycle, if the catalyst speciation is at steady-state then the rates of off-cycle steps are irrelevant to rate control. Under steady-state conditions, the presence of off-cycle species serves only to lower the catalytic efficiency by lowering the on-cycle catalyst concentrations."
120,Development of a Creatinine ELISA and an Amperometric Antibody-Based Creatinine Sensor with a Detection Limit in the Nanomolar Range,A. Benkert;F. Scheller;W. Schössler;C. Hentschel;B. Micheel;O. Behrsing;G. Scharte;W. Stöcklein;A. Warsinke,Analytical Chemistry,"Creatinine-specific antibodies have been generated and used for highly sensitive and specific immunochemical creatinine determinations. Creatinine was derivatized at N3 and coupled to KLH carrier protein. On the basis of this immunogen, monoclonal antibodies were developed by hybridoma technology. Antibodies from various clones have been characterized with BIAcore 2000 with respect to the dissociation constant and specificity. Antibodies of clone B90-AH5 exhibited the lowest dissociation constant (0.74 μM) and the highest specificity for creatinine and were chosen for the development of a competitive ELISA and an amperometric creatinine sensor. The creatinine sensor was constructed by fixing a creatinine-modified membrane on the top of a platinum working electrode which was then incorporated into a stirred electrochemical measuring cell. For creatinine determination the creatinine-containing sample was incubated with B90-AH5 and anti-IgG(mouse)−glucose oxidase conjugate and applied to the measuring cell. After a washing step glucose was added and the produced hydrogen peroxide was registrated at Eappl = +600 mV vs Ag/AgCl. The measuring range was 0.01−10 μg/mL. The highest sensitivity for creatinine was achieved at 330 ng/mL (3 μM) and the lower detection limit at 4.5 ng/mL (40 nM). This is far below the relevant clinical range, which is 5−17 μg/mL (44−150 μM) and allows a reliable determination of very low creatinine concentrations in serum, where standard methods cannot be applied. After each measurement the sensor was regenerated with 10 mM HCl without any loss in binding activity."

Prosperi;M. Battilani,Journal of Virological Methods,"Canine adenovirus type 1 (CAdV-1) and canine adenovirus type 2 (CAdV-2) cause infectious canine hepatitis (ICH) and infectious tracheobronchitis (ITB) in dogs, respectively. Cases of ICH have been documented in recent years and recent surveys have demonstrated a wide percentage of asymptomatic CAdV-1 infection in the canine population. Since both CAdV types are detectable in the same biological matrices, and viral coinfection with CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 are reported with high frequency, it is urgent to have available a rapid, highly sensitive and specific assay for the diagnosis of CAdV infection and distinction between CAdV-1 and CAdV-2.In order to detect canine adenovirus in biological samples and to rapidly distinguish the two viral types, a SYBR Green real-time PCR assay was optimized to discriminate CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 via a melting curve analysis. The developed assay showed high sensitivity and reproducibility and was highly efficient and specific in discriminating the two CAdV types.This reliable and rapid technique may represent a simple, useful and economic option for simultaneous CAdV types detection, which would be feasible and attractive for all diagnostic laboratories, both for clinical purposes and for epidemiological investigations."

All real-world applications have unique features. Not infrequently these loom large enough to dominate the design effort. By discussing what are admittedly unique features of the present project, we shall nevertheless cast light upon the general requirement for appropriate HCI tools and techniques in present-day teaching media. We also aim to share our experience of using HyperCard, running on the Apple Macintosh computer, as a course-authoring system."

The proposed code is developed to be implemented in non-coherent Optical Code Division Multiple Access (OCDMA) systems. Numerical results of the design construction show that the proposed code enhances the system performance by improving its capacity, reducing the signal-to-noise ratio, and increasing the data rate. The system output performance for active user number is equal to 1.09, 1.54, 2.14, 2.215, 3.89 and 5.14 times than those of, Two Dimensional Multi-Diagonal (2D-MD), Two Dimensional Dynamic Cyclic Shift (2D-DCS), (1D-SWZCC), Two Dimension Perfect Difference (2D-PD), Two Dimensional Hybrid Flexible Cross Correlation- Modified Double Weight (FCC/MDW) and Two Dimensional Extended Enhanced Double Weight (2D-extended-EDW) codes, respectively. It can save an effective power around −3.2 dBm and −1.4 dBm at the level of the receiver compared to 2D-DCS and 2D-MD codes. Moreover, the system performance has been studied using Optisystem software. The simulation results show that the system respects the optical transmission property accommodating four users for a power of the source equal to −10 dBm, and the data rate is 1 Gbps."

Moreover, the classical microbiological analyses are lengthy, costly and destructive. In this study a portable fluorescence spectrometer was tested to quantify minced beef spoilage. This study was investigated on samples stored aerobically and under vacuum at 5 and 15 °C. Total viable counts (TVC), Pseudomonas, lactic acid bacteria, and yeast/molds counts were investigated with classical culture methods. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on the same samples using different excitation LEDs (280, 320, and 380 nm). PLS-R with leave-one-out cross validation was used to perform calibration and validation models. The PLS-R models presented good R2CV (0.50–0.99) and ratio of standard deviation (RPDCV: 1.40–8.95) values after cross-validation.

Mateu,Preventive Veterinary Medicine,"In the present study a risk assessment tool was developed for improving biosecurity on pig farms as part of a voluntary program for PRRS control on farms located in NE Spain. The arrival of the PRRS virus through different routes was estimated based on their likelihood of harbouring the virus and the estimation of a score for the probability of introduction. For each possible route of introduction or spread within the herds, single or combined biosecurity measures aimed at reducing the probability of PRRS virus transmission were selected. Results showed that the scores for the probability of introduction and spreading were related to a highly variable application of biosecurity measures. The tool developed in the present study may be suitable for identifying where efforts should be focused in biosecurity actions forming part of disease control programs."
126,Development of a technique for recording the focal rod ERG,A. Binns;T. Margrain,Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics,"The scotopic ERG recorded in response to a focal stimulus has a double b‐wave. The first wave results from direct focal stimulation of the retina, and the second originates in the peripheral retina in response to scattered light. The aim of this study was to assess two possible protocols for the isolation of the focal rod response, namely ‘Subtraction’ and ‘Background Adaptation’ techniques. The Subtraction technique involved the recording of a full‐field response, which matched the b‐wave elicited by intraocular light scatter, and the subtraction of this full‐field response from the initial trace to isolate the focal component. In the Background Adaptation technique an adapting surround was used to suppress the response from the peripheral retina. Focal rod responses were isolated with both techniques. However, the Background Adaptation technique was found to more reliably elicit a focal response with a measurable a‐wave, and was also considerably less time consuming than the Subtraction technique."

Choi,Journal of Constructional Steel Research,"This paper presents the development of Ramberg–Osgood and Three-Parameter Power model prediction equations for the moment–rotation (M–θ) behavior of flush end-plate connections with one row of bolts below tension and compression flanges. A finite element model (FEM) of the connection region along with the connected beam and column is developed for load deformation analyses, which included material, geometric, and contact nonlinearities. The FEM model was verified with test results conducted and reported for flush end-plate connections in the literature during the 1980s. A matrix of test cases was obtained by varying the geometric variables of flush end-plate connections within their practical ranges. The connection M–θ data for these test cases were obtained by FEM analyses, which were then curve fitted to Ramberg–Osgood and Three-Parameter Power model equations to obtain parameters defining these equations. Finally, prediction equations were developed for parameters of the model equations as functions of geometric variables of the flush end-plate connections."

Carmona,Energy and Buildings,"Smart gypsum composites were manufactured by adding different kinds of microcapsules containing phase change materials (PCMs) in order to develop building materials with high thermal energy storage (TES) capacity useful for being applied in high comfort constructive systems. The physical, thermal and mechanical properties of these composites such as density, porosity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity (k), equivalent heat capacity (cp), the accumulated heat power (qacc) and the maximum compressive strength were studied. Results showed that the higher the microcapsules content, the lower the density and k and the higher the cp and qacc, due to the PCM action. Besides, the addition of 15 wt% of microcapsules respect to the hemihydrate would allow to save 4.5 kWh of energy per operating cycle in a standard room covered with 1 m3 of this gypsum. This energy is equivalent to the energy spent by three incandescent light bulbs of 60-W kept on all the day and a reduction of 1.395 kg of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. The addition of these thermoregulating materials to gypsum decreases their compressive strength but all the developed materials satisfied the Spanish mechanical regulations for gypsum as building material, being possible to increase the total amount of added microcapsules."
129,Development of the Zuckerman–Kuhlman–Aluja Personality Questionnaire (ZKA–PQ): A Factor/Facet Version of the Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ),A. Aluja;M. Kuhlman;M. Zuckerman,Journal of Personality Assessment,"The development of a new 200-item questionnaire based on the theoretical constructs of the alternative Five-factor model of personality is described. We developed the Zuckerman–Kuhlman–Aluja Personality Questionnaire (ZKA–PQ) from an initial pool of 537 items. Its final version includes 5 factors with 4 facets per factor and 10 items per facet. Internal consistencies were adequate particularly for the factors. The 1 factor confirmatory factor analyses showed satisfactory goodness-of-fit indexes, but not for the 5 factor simple structure. When incorporating the secondary loadings and the correlated error terms, the model fit improved. A multigroup analysis showed gender differences for the factors Sensation Seeking, Neuroticism, Aggressiveness, and Activity for the Spanish-speaking sample but only for Aggressiveness in the English-speaking sample. We assessed the convergent and discriminant validity of the ZKA–PQ by inspecting correlations with shortened versions of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992 Costa, P. T. Jr. and McCrae, R. R. 1992. NEO Personality Inventory (NEO–PI–R), Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources.

This new instrument may be useful for basic and applied research, including normal personality, psychobiology of personality, personality and clinical disorders, and industrial-organizational psychology."
130,Development of thermoresponsive poly(propylene-g-N-isopropylacrylamide) non-woven 3D scaffold for smart cell culture using oxyfluorination-assisted graft polymerisation,A. Chetty;V. Vargha;A. Maity;F. Moolman;W. Focke,Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects,"Growing cells on 3D scaffolds is far superior to the conventional 2D monolayer culture method. In this study, a novel 3D thermoresponsive poly(propylene-g-N-isopropylacrylamide) (PP-g-PNIPAAm) non-woven fabric (gNWF) was developed for cell culture using oxyfluorination-assisted graft polymerisation (OAGP). New polar functional groups were detected on the oxyfluorinated NWF (oNWF), and PNIPAAm was confirmed in the gNWF by attentuated total-reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) and scanning X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (S-XPS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a rough surface morphology and confinement of the PNIPAAm graft layer to the surface of the fibres in the gNWF. The OAGP method did not affect the crystalline phase of bulk PP, however, twin-melting thermal peaks were detected for the oNWF and gNWF indicating crystal defects. Contact angle studies showed that the surface of the gNWF exhibited a thermoresponsive behaviour. Hepatocyte cells attached onto gNWF disks in a bioreactor at 37 °C and remained viable for 10 days in culture. Upon cooling the cell culture media to 20 °C, cells were spontaneously released as 3D multi-cellular constructs without requiring destructive enzymes.

132,Developmental mechanisms underlying polydactyly in the mouse mutant Doublefoot,A. Crick;C. Babbs;J. Brown;G. Morriss‐Kay,Journal of Anatomy,"The pre‐axial polydactylous mouse mutant Doublefoot has 6–9 digits per limb but lacks anteroposterior polarity (there is no biphalangeal digit 1). It differs from other polydactylous mutants in showing normal Shh expression, but polarizing activity (shown by mouse‐chick grafting experiments) and hedgehog signalling activity (shown by expression of Ptc1) are present throughout the distal mesenchyme. The Dbf mutation has not yet been identified. Here we review current understanding of this mutant, and briefly report new results indicating (1) that limb bud expansion is concomitant with ectopic Ihh expression and with extension of the posterior high cell proliferation rate into the anterior region, and (2) that the Dbf mutation is epistatic to Shh in the limb."
133,Developmental patterning by gradients of mobile small RNAs,A. Benkovics;M. Timmermans,Current Opinion in Genetics and Development,"Development of multicellular organisms depends on intercellular communication via mobile signals that provide positional information to coordinate cell fate decisions. In addition to peptide ligands, transcription factors, and hormones, plants use small RNAs as positional instructive signals. The unique patterning properties of small RNA gradients resulting from regulated mobility suggest conceptual similarities to the function of animal morphogens, and provide robustness and precision to the formation of cell fate boundaries. While common principles may underlie the formation, stability, and interpretation of both plant small RNA and animal morphogen gradients, the unique nature of small RNAs with respect to their biogenesis and target regulation imply important differences as well. In this review, we discuss the patterning properties of mobile small RNAs and highlight recent studies that have advanced our understanding of how small RNAs move, and how the graded accumulation that underlies their patterning activity could be created, maintained, and interpreted."
134,Deviations from Off-Diagonal Long-Range Order in One-Dimensional Quantum Systems,A. Colcelli;G. Mussardo;A. Trombettoni,ArXiv Physics,"A quantum system exhibits off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) when the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ of the one-body-density matrix scales as $\lambda_0 \sim N$, where $N$ is the total number of particles. Putting $\lambda_0 \sim N^{{\cal C}}$ to define the scaling exponent ${\cal C}$, then ${\cal C}=1$ corresponds to ODLRO and ${\cal C}=0$ to the single-particle occupation of the density matrix orbitals. When $0<{\cal C}<1$, ${\cal C}$ can be used to quantify deviations from ODLRO. In this paper we study the exponent ${\cal C}$ in a variety of one-dimensional bosonic and anyonic quantum systems. For the $1D$ Lieb-Liniger Bose gas we find that for small interactions ${\cal C}$ is close to $1$, implying a mesoscopic condensation, i.e. a value of the ""condensate"" fraction $\lambda_0/N$ appreciable at finite values of $N$ (as the ones in experiments with $1D$ ultracold atoms). $1D$ anyons provide the possibility to fully interpolate between ${\cal C}=1$ and $0$. The behaviour of ${\cal C}$ for these systems is found to be non-monotonic both with respect to the coupling constant and the statistical parameter."

León,"Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms","The onset of non Rutherford cross section for medium heavy elements like Cu (Z = 29; A = 63, 65) and Zn (Z = 30; A = 64, 66, 67, 68, 70) for He as a projectile is studied by means of elastic backscattering measurements made on pure Cu and Zn material samples with He ions at energy ranges from 3 to 10 MeV. The scattering cross section relative to Rutherford value is extracted from the experimental values in an energy range from 7 to 10 MeV with the help of available computer codes for the simulation of elastic backscattering spectra. The measured energy value for the onset of the deviation of the Rutherford value is in agreement with the calculations of Bozoian et al. (1990) [14]."
136,Diabetes complications in childhood and adolescent onset type 2 diabetes—a review,A. Amutha;V. Mohan,Journal of Diabetes and its Complications,"Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common endocrine disorders in children. Earlier, diabetes in children was almost exclusively type 1 diabetes. Recently, the scenario has changed and increasing numbers of children and adolescent T2DM are being diagnosed. As the epidemic of T2DM shifts to children and adolescents, there is an increased risk of development of micro and macrovascular complications. This could potentially affect the economy of the nation apart from posing a large burden to the individual and his or her family. Prevention and treatment are especially important, given the fact that onset at an early age increases the risk of developing micro and macrovascular complications due to increased duration of exposure to hyperglycemia and other metabolic abnormalities. Diagnosing children and adolescents with T2DM early and instituting good control of all risk factors could yield good results in the prevention of long term complications of diabetes. This review focuses on the prevalence of complications of diabetes among children and adolescents with T2DM."
137,Diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in the paediatric and transitional age,A. Chinoy;P. Murray,Best Practice and Research in Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,"Growth hormone deficiency is a rare cause of childhood short stature, but one for which treatment exists in the form of recombinant human growth hormone. A diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency is made based on auxology, biochemistry and imaging. Although no diagnostic gold standard exists, growth hormone provocation tests are considered the mainstay of diagnostic investigations. However, these must be interpreted with caution in view of issues with variability and reproducibility, as well as the limited evidence-base for cut-off values used to distinguish growth hormone deficient and non-growth hormone deficient subjects. In addition, nutritional and pubertal status can affect results, with no consensus on the role of priming with sex steroid hormones. Difficulties with assays exist both for growth hormone as well as insulin-like growth factor-1. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging is a useful diagnostic, and possibly prognostic, aid. Although genetic testing is not routine, the discovery of more relevant mutations makes it an increasingly important investigation. Children with growth hormone deficiency are retested biochemically on completion of growth, to assess whether they remain so into adulthood."
138,Diagnostic Accuracy of Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging Versus Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Early Response Assessment of Liver Metastases to Y90-Radioembolization,A. Barabasch;N. Kraemer;A. Ciritsis;N. Hansen;M. Lierfeld;A. Heinzel;C. Trautwein;U. Neumann;C. Kuhl,Investigative Radiology,"Objectives: Patients with hepatic metastases who are candidates for Y90 - radioembolization ( Y90 -RE) usually have advanced tumor stages with involvement of both liver lobes. Per current guidelines, these patients have usually undergone several cycles of potentially hepatotoxic systemic chemotherapy before Y90 -RE is at all considered, requiring split (lobar) treatment sessions to reduce hepatic toxicity. Assessing response to Y90 -RE early, that is, already after the first lobar session, would be helpful to avoid an ineffective and potentially hepatotoxic second lobar treatment. We investigated the accuracy with which diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( DWI -MRI) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) can provide this information. Methods: An institutional review board–approved prospective intraindividual comparison trial on 35 patients who underwent fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT and DWI -MRI within 6 weeks before and 6 weeks after Y90 -RE to treat secondary-progressive liver metastases from solid cancers (20 colorectal, 13 breast, 2 other) was performed. An increase of minimal apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmin) or decrease of maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) by at least 30% was regarded as positive response. Long-term clinical and imaging follow-up was used to distinguish true- from false-response classifications. Results: On the basis of long-term follow-up, 23 (66%) of 35 patients responded to the Y90 treatment. No significant changes of metastases size or contrast enhancement were observable on pretreatment versus posttreatment CT or magnetic resonance images.However, overall SUVmax decreased from 8.0 ± 3.9 to 5.5 ± 2.2 ( P < 0.0001), and ADCmin increased from 0.53 ± 0.13 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s to 0.77 ± 0.26 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s ( P < 0.0001). Pretherapeutic versus posttherapeutic changes of ADCmin and SUVmax correlated moderately ( r = −0.53). In 4 of the 35 patients (11%), metastases were fluorodeoxyglucose-negative such that no response assessment was possible by PET. In 25 (71%) of the 35 patients, response classification by PET and DWI -MRI was concordant; in 6 (17%) of the 35, it was discordant. In 5 of the 6 patients with discordant classifications, follow-up confirmed diagnoses made by DWI . The positive predictive value to predict response was 22 (96%) of 23 for MRI and 15 (88%) of 17 for PET. The negative predictive value to predict absence was 11 (92%) of 12 for MRI and 10 (56%) of 18 for PET. Sensitivity for detecting response was significantly higher for MRI (96%; 22/23) than for PET (65%; 15/23) ( P < 0.02). Conclusions: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging appears superior to PET/CT for early response assessment in patients with hepatic metastases of common solid tumors. It may be used in between lobar treatment sessions to guide further management of patients who undergo Y90 -RE for hepatic metastases."

Tacke,Inorganic Chemistry,"Reaction of Si(OMe)4 with acetohydroxamic acid or benzohydroxamic acid and HNMe2 (molar ratio 1:3:2) in MeCN yielded dimethylammonium fac-tris[acetohydroximato(2−)]silicate (fac-5) and N,N-dimethylacetamidinium fac-tris[benzohydroximato(2−)]silicate (fac-8), respectively. Reaction of Si(OMe)4 with benzohydroxamic acid and HNMe2 (molar ratio 1:3:2) or ethane-1,2-diamine (molar ratio 1:3:1) in MeOH gave dimethylammonium fac-tris[benzohydroximato(2−)]silicate−methanol (fac-6·MeOH) and ethane-1,2-diammonium mer-tris[benzohydroximato(2−)]silicate−dimethanol (mer-9·2MeOH), respectively. Reaction of Ge(OMe)4 with benzohydroxamic acid and HNMe2 (molar ratio 1:3:2) in MeOH resulted in the formation of dimethylammonium fac-tris[benzohydroximato(2−)]germanate−methanol (fac-7·MeOH). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies showed that the Si(Ge)-coordination polyhedra of the racemic hexacoordinate silicon (germanium) compounds fac-5, fac-6·MeOH, fac-7·MeOH, fac-8, and mer-9·2MeOH are distorted octahedra. All compounds were additionally characterized by solid-state VACP/MAS NMR studies (13C, 15N, 29Si). The structural investigations were complemented by computational studies of the dianions of fac-5 and mer-5."

Bunge;L. Magerusan;I. Morjan;R. Turcu;G. Borodi;J. Liebscher,Journal of Nanoparticle Research,"New magnetic Fe@C nanoparticles in the size range of about 20–50 nm functionalized with amino, hydroxy, propargyl, or maleinimido groups were synthesized by reaction with aryl diazonium salts. Aryl diazonium salts wherein the functional groups are linked via a sulfonamide moiety turned out to be advantageous over those with direct linkage. The obtained Fe@C nanoparticles represent magnetic nanoplatforms for linking bio-entities and organocatalysts using amide formation, CuAAC, or thiol-ene click chemistry as exemplified by selected examples. The Fe@C nanoparticles obtained exhibit supramolecular behavior with high value of saturation magnetization rendering them attractive for practical applications in biomedicine and organocatalysis.

142,Differences by sex in IgG levels following infant and childhood vaccinations: An individual participant data meta-analysis of vaccination studies,A. Boef;F. Klis;G. Berbers;A. Buisman;M. Knol,Vaccine,"If immune responses to vaccination differ between males and females, sex-specific vaccination schedules may be indicated. We systematically reanalysed childhood vaccination studies conducted in The Netherlands for sex-differences in IgG-responses. To assess the impact of potential sex-differences in IgG-responses, we explored sex-differences in vaccine failure/effectiveness and reactogenicity.Six studies with IgG-measurements for 1577 children following infant pneumococcal (PCV7/PCV10/PCV13) and/or DTaP-IPV-Hib(-HepB) vaccinations, or the pre-school DTaP-IPV booster were included. We performed one-stage individual participant data meta-analyses per time-point of the effect of sex on IgG levels against pneumococcal serotypes, diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis Ptx/FHA/Prn and Hib-PRP using linear mixed models. Using existing study data, we compared reactogenicity after PCV7/PCV10 and DTaP-IPV-Hib(-HepB) vaccination in girls and boys. Vaccine failure/effectiveness was compared between girls and boys for invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), invasive Hib disease and pertussis using notification data.For pneumococcal vaccination, the geometric mean concentration ratio of IgG levels in girls versus boys pooled across serotypes was 1.15 (95%CI 0.91–1.45) 1 month following the primary series, 1.16 (1.02–1.32) at age 8 months, 1.12 (1.02–1.23) pre-booster (age 11 months) and 0.99 (0.89–1.10) post-booster (age 12 months). Diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, pertussis Ptx/FHA/Prn and Hib-PRP IgG levels did not differ between girls and boys, except for Hib post-booster (1.24; 95%CI 1.01–1.52) and tetanus before pre-school booster (0.71; 0.53–0.95). We found no difference between boys and girls in reactogenicity at age 4 or 11 months or in vaccine failure/effectiveness for IPD, invasive Hib disease or pertussis.For most vaccine antigens investigated, there were no consistent differences in vaccine-induced IgG levels. Vaccine-induced pneumococcal IgG levels were slightly higher in girls, but only between the primary series and the 11-month booster. These results, along with similar reactogenicity and vaccine failure/effectiveness, support the uniform infant vaccination schedule in the Dutch national immunisation programme."

Significant relationships were noted with regard to production system and individual bioactive milk compounds, that is β‐lactoglobulin, lactoferrin, lysozyme, vitamins A, D3 and E, and β‐carotene (P = 0.001) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (P = 0.016). Milk obtained from extensive farms, especially certified organic ones, was a valuable source of certain antioxidant compounds: β‐lactoglobulin (3.32 g/L), lactoferrin (123.8 mg/L), vitamin E (2.044 mg/L) and β‐carotene (0.257 mg/L) in the case of organic farms."
144,Differences in ischemic damage between young and old hearts — Effects of blood cardioplegia,A. Böning;S. Rohrbach;L. Kohlhepp;M. Heep;C. Mühlfeld,Experimental Gerontology,"Senescent patients exhibit an elevated perioperative risk for cardiac dysfunction, hemodynamic depression and subsequent cardiac death compared to young patients. Despite the fact that a growing proportion of cardiac surgery patients are octogenarians, cardioplegic regimes remain comparable across patients of all ages. We compared the hemodynamic performance, metabolic parameters and ultrastructural changes in adult and senescent rat hearts after application of Buckberg's blood cardioplegia (BCP) to evaluate differences between the age groups regarding postischemic myocardial function and cellular ultrastructure.Hearts of adult (young adult group, 3–4 months) and senescent (old group, 24 months) male Wistar rats were excised and inserted into a blood perfused isolated heart apparatus (Langendorff perfusion). After a stabilization period of 30 min, in 16 adult and 16 senescent hearts, Buckberg BCP was administered antegradely and repeated every 20 min. Six young adult and 3 senescent hearts served as ischemia control. After an aortic clamping time of 90 min an antegrade hot shot was administered. During reperfusion ex vivo cardiac functional parameters were recorded, including coronary blood flow, left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and velocity of myocardial contraction or relaxation (+/− dp/dt). Oxygen consumption and lactate production of the hearts were calculated. After perfusion fixation, the hearts of five rats in each BCP group and 3 rats in each ischemia group were investigated for cellular edema and mitochondrial damage by morphometry using transmission electron microscopy.While recovery of cardiac function after 90 min of unprotected ischemia was significantly impaired in senescent hearts, functional recovery after ischemia protected by BCP was similar in adult and senescent hearts. Mitochondrial ultrastructure was severely damaged in both age groups after 90 min ischemia, but well preserved in both BCP groups. The qualitative analysis was confirmed by the morphometric cellular edema index and the volume-to-surface ratio of the mitochondria. Myocardial oxygen consumption was highest and lactate production was lowest in senescent hearts.Senescent rat hearts were more susceptible to unprotected ischemia/reperfusion injury than young adult hearts. When protected by BCP, we found no difference in hemodynamic performance between adult and senescent hearts indicating preserved myocardial protection even in senescent individuals.Knowledge regarding cardioplegia in senescent patients is limited.After 90 min of ischemia alone, cardiac function was reduced in all animal hearts.After ischemia, cardiac function was better preserved in adult than in senescent hearts.After cardioplegia, maintenance of ultrastructure was similar in adult and senescent hearts.Buckberg's blood cardioplegia is advantageous for adult and senescent hearts.Senescent patients exhibit an elevated perioperative risk for cardiac dysfunction, hemodynamic depression and subsequent cardiac death compared to young patients.

145,Differences in spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity of flight control in the honeybees Apis cerana and Apis melliferaDifferences in spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity of flight control in the honeybees Apis cerana and Apis melliferaDifferences in spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity of flight control in the honeybees Apis cerana and Apis mellifera,A. Chakravarthi;S. Rajus;A. Kelber;M. Dacke;E. Baird,Journal of Experimental Biology,"Visually guided behaviour is constrained by the capacity of the visual system to resolve detail. This, in turn, is limited by the spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity of the underlying visual system. Because these properties are interdependent and vary non-uniformly, it is only possible to fully understand the limits of a specific visually guided behaviour when they are investigated in combination. To understand the visual limits of flight control in bees, which rely heavily on vision to control flight, and to explore whether they vary between species, we tested how changes in spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity affect the speed and position control of the Asian and European honeybees (Apis cerana and Apis mellifera). Despite the apparent similarity of these species, we found some interesting and surprising differences between their visual limits. While the effect of spatial frequency and contrast on position control is similar between the species, ground speed is differently affected by these variables. A comparison with published data from the bumblebee Bombus terrestris revealed further differences. The visual resolution that limits the detection and use of optic flow for flight control in both species of honeybee is lower than the previously anatomically determined resolution and differs from object detection limits of A. mellifera, providing evidence that the limits of spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity are highly tuned to the particular behavioural task of a species."
146,Differences in the Heritability of Growth and Growth Velocity During Infancy and Associations With FTO Variants,A. Choh;J. Curran;A. Odegaard;R. Nahhas;S. Czerwinski;J. Blangero;B. Towne;E. Demerath,Obesity,"While the associations of common variants in the FTO gene with obesity have been widely replicated in adults, there is conflicting evidence regarding their effects in infancy. We hypothesize that the genetic influences on growth traits vary during infancy, and that conflicting results may stem from variation in the ages at which FTO associations have been examined. Using longitudinal weight and length data at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months in 917 (444 females, 473 males) family members from the Fels Longitudinal Study, we used a variance components‐based approach (SOLAR) to: (i) examine differences in heritability (gene‐by‐age interaction) in weight, length, relative weight (BMI and ponderal index (PI)) and instantaneous weight and length velocities over the course of infancy, and (ii) test whether a common FTO variant (rs9939609) was associated with infant growth at three ages (maximum trait heritability, birth and 36 months). All heritabilities at birth (of 39–74%) were significant (P &lt; 3.9 × 10−10), but changed with age (gene‐by‐age interaction, P &lt; 0.05). Weight, relative weight, and weight velocity reached maximum heritabilities (of 76–89%) at 6–9 months, while length and length velocity reached maximum heritabilities (of 96–99%) at 18–30 months. We found no association of rs9939609 with growth status or velocity measured at any age (P &gt; 0.11). This study for the first time demonstrates the fluctuation of genetic influences on infant growth, but further work is required to determine which gene variants explain the strong additive genetic effects observed."
147,Different Mutagenic Potential of HIV-1 Restriction Factors APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F Is Determined by Distinct Single-Stranded DNA Scanning Mechanisms,A. Ara;R. Love;L. Chelico,PLOS Pathogens,"The APOBEC3 deoxycytidine deaminase family functions as host restriction factors that can block replication of Vif (virus infectivity factor) deficient HIV-1 virions to differing degrees by deaminating cytosines to uracils in single-stranded (−)HIV-1 DNA. Upon replication of the (−)DNA to (+)DNA, the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase incorporates adenines opposite the uracils, thereby inducing C/G→T/A mutations that can functionally inactivate HIV-1. Although both APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G are expressed in cell types HIV-1 infects and are suppressed by Vif, there has been no prior biochemical analysis of APOBEC3F, in contrast to APOBEC3G. Using synthetic DNA substrates, we characterized APOBEC3F and found that similar to APOBEC3G; it is a processive enzyme and can deaminate at least two cytosines in a single enzyme-substrate encounter. However, APOBEC3F scanning movement is distinct from APOBEC3G, and relies on jumping rather than both jumping and sliding. APOBEC3F jumping movements were also different from APOBEC3G. The lack of sliding movement from APOBEC3F is due to an 190NPM192 motif, since insertion of this motif into APOBEC3G decreases its sliding movements. The APOBEC3G NPM mutant induced significantly less mutations in comparison to wild-type APOBEC3G in an in vitro model HIV-1 replication assay and single-cycle infectivity assay, indicating that differences in DNA scanning were relevant to restriction of HIV-1. Conversely, mutation of the APOBEC3F 191Pro to 191Gly enables APOBEC3F sliding movements to occur. Although APOBEC3F 190NGM192 could slide, the enzyme did not induce more mutagenesis than wild-type APOBEC3F, demonstrating that the unique jumping mechanism of APOBEC3F abrogates the influence of sliding on mutagenesis. Overall, we demonstrate key differences in the impact of APOBEC3F- and APOBEC3G-induced mutagenesis on HIV-1 that supports a model in which both the processive DNA scanning mechanism and preferred deamination motif (APOBEC3F, 5′TTC; APOBEC3G 5′CCC) influences the mutagenic and gene inactivation potential of an APOBEC3 enzyme."
148,Differential roles for cortical versus sub-cortical noradrenaline and modulation of impulsivity in the rat,A. Benn;E. Robinson,Psychopharmacology,"Rationale Atomoxetine is a noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor licensed for the treatment of adult and childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Although atomoxetine has established efficacy, the mechanisms which mediate its effects are not well understood. Objectives In this study, we investigated the role of cortical versus sub-cortical noradrenaline by using focal dopamine beta hydroxylase-saporin-induced lesions, to the prefrontal cortex ( n = 16) or nucleus accumbens shell ( n = 18). Methods Healthy animals were tested by using the forced-choice serial reaction time task to assess the impact of the lesion on baseline performance and the response to atomoxetine and the psychostimulant amphetamine. Results We observed attenuation in the efficacy of atomoxetine in animals with lesions to the nucleus accumbens shell, but not the prefrontal cortex. Amphetamine-induced increases in premature responses were potentiated in animals with lesions to the prefrontal cortex, but not the nucleus accumbens shell. Conclusions These data suggest that noradrenaline in the nucleus accumbens shell plays an important role in the effects of atomoxetine. Under these conditions, prefrontal cortex noradrenaline did not appear to contribute to atomoxetine’s effects suggesting a lack of cortical-mediated “top-down” modulation. Noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex appears to contribute to the modulation of impulsive responding in amphetamine-treated animals, with a loss of noradrenaline associated with potentiation of its effects. These data demonstrate a potential dissociation between cortical and sub-cortical noradrenergic mechanisms and impulse control in terms of the actions of atomoxetine and amphetamine."
149,"Differentiation of abilities, socioeconomic status, and the WISC.",A. Cropley,Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,"The study investigated the effect of an increase in age on the factor structures of the subtests of the WISC, and the relationship between subtest scores and socioeconomic status (SES). The scores of 70 Ss, tested at ages 10 and 12, were factor analyzed and structures at the 2 age levels compared. The sample was also divided into high and low SES groups, and subtest means calculated for each group. At both age levels, between-group mean differences were significant at or beyond the .05 level of confidence in the case of verbal subtests, while factor structures, which were similar, indicated a trend towards integration of abilities. The structures defined 2 main factors, identified as verbal and performance IQ, respectively. (31 ref.)"
150,Dimensional Pathological Personality Predicting Personality Disorders: Comparison of the DAPP-BQ and PID-5 Shortened Versions in a Spanish Community Sample,A. Aluja;L. García;L. Cuevas;I. Lucas,Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment,"This study explored the psychometric properties of the shortened forms of The Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology (DAPP-BQ) and The Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) in a large cohort from a Spanish community and compared simultaneously the predictive power with regard to personality disorders (PDs) scores in the International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE). The IPDE is a self-report inventory of 77 items. Each item measures a criterion and a dimensional score can be obtained for each personality disorder. Both shortened forms (named DAPP-90 and PID-5/SF, respectively) obtained a good structural validity and reliability. Linear regression analysis showed that both questionnaires were predictive of the PDs scores. DAPP-90 factors explained about 25% of PDs variance (37% of the PDs clusters). Facets slightly increased the percentages accounting for PDs variance and clusters to 31% and 43%, respectively. PID-5/SF factors, meanwhile, explained 23% of PDs and 33% of PDs clusters, while the facets accounted for 25% of PDs and 37% of clusters. It is concluded that both questionnaires were good instruments for measuring pathological personality, and predicted a similar part of the variance in PDs. However, given that neither the DAPP-90 nor the PID-5/SF accounted for all the variation in PDs, categorical classification of the broader set of PDs may continue to be desired by some researchers and practicing clinicians."

[Revised NEO-PI-R, French adaptation: Manual] [Google Scholar]) demonstrated that Neuroticism correlated strongly and Extraversion and Conscientiousness moderately with the RSES. Depression accounted for 47% of the variance of the RSES. Other NEO–PI–R facets were also moderately related with self-esteem."
152,Direct democracy and resource allocation: Experimental evidence from Afghanistan,A. Beath;F. Christia;R. Enikolopov,Journal of Development Economics,"Direct democracy is designed to better align policy outcomes with citizen preferences. To test this proposition, we randomized whether 250 villages across Afghanistan selected projects by secret-ballot referenda or by consultation meetings. We find that referenda reduce the influence of local elites over both project type and location. Consistent with previous experimental results, we also find that referenda improve villagers' perceptions of the local economy and of the quality of local governance. However, we find no systematic evidence that selecting projects via referenda increases the average impact of such projects."
153,Discharge coefficients for flow through holes normal to a rotating shaft,A. Alexiou;N. Hills;C. Long;A. Turner;J. Millward,International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow,"A possible design for a more compact gas turbine engine uses contra-rotating high pressure (HP) and intermediate pressure (IP) turbine discs. Cooling air for the IP turbine stages is taken from the compressor and transferred to the turbine stage via holes in the drive shaft. The aim of this work was to investigate the discharge coefficient characteristics of the holes in this rotating shaft, and, in particular, to ascertain whether the sense of rotation of the shaft with respect to the discs affected these significantly. This paper reports mostly on experimental measurements of the discharge coefficients. Some CFD modelling of this flow was carried out and this has helped to explain the experimental work. The experimental results show the effects on the discharge coefficient of rotational speed, flow rate, and co- and contra-rotations of the shaft relative to the discs. The measured values of the discharge coefficient are compared with established experimental data for non-rotating holes in the presence of a cross-flow. For stationary shaft and discs, co-rotation of the shaft and discs and differential rotation with the disc speed less than the shaft (in the same rotational direction), the discharge coefficients are in reasonable agreement with these data. For differential rotation (including contra-rotation) with the disc speed greater than the shaft, there is a significant decrease in discharge coefficient.A possible design for a more compact gas turbine engine uses contra-rotating high pressure (HP) and intermediate pressure (IP) turbine discs.

154,Discrete phase numerical model and experimental study of hybrid nanofluid heat transfer and pressure drop in plate heat exchanger,A. Bhattad;J. Sarkar;P. Ghosh,International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer,"In the present study, numerical as well as experimental investigations have been done on the plate heat exchanger using hybrid nanofluid (Al2O3 + MWCNT/water) at different concentration to investigate its effect on heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics. Discrete phase model has been used for the investigation using CFD software and results have been compared with the experimental result as well as result of the homogenous model. Effects of different operating parameters (nanofluid inlet temperature, flow rate and volume concentration) have been studied on coolant outlet temperature, heat transfer rate, convective and overall heat transfer coefficients, Nusselt number, friction factor, pressure drop, pumping power, effectiveness and performance index. Velocity and temperature profiles have been also studied for base fluid, nanofluid and hybrid nanofluid. By using hybrid nanofluid, heat transfer coefficient enhances by 39.16% (merit) with negligible increase in pumping power of 1.23% (demerit). An enhancement in heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics; and hence on the effectiveness of plate heat exchanger has been observed while using hybrid nanofluids instead of base fluid.In the present study, numerical as well as experimental investigations have been done on the plate heat exchanger using hybrid nanofluid (Al2O3 + MWCNT/water) at different concentration to investigate its effect on heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics.

155,Dispersal of thermophilic beetles across the intercontinental Arctic forest belt during the early Eocene,A. Brunke;S. Chatzimanolis;B. Metscher;K. Wolf-Schwenninger;A. Solodovnikov,Scientific Reports (Solid Earth Sciences),"Massive biotic change occurred during the Eocene as the climate shifted from warm and equable to seasonal and latitudinally stratified. Mild winter temperatures across Arctic intercontinental land bridges permitted dispersal of frost-intolerant groups until the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, while trans-Arctic dispersal in thermophilic groups may have been limited to the early Eocene, especially during short-lived hyperthermals. Some of these lineages are now disjunct between continents of the northern hemisphere. Although Eocene climate change may have been one of the most important drivers of these ancient patterns in modern animal and plant distributions, its particular events are rarely implicated or correlated with group-specific climatic requirements. Here we explored the climatic and geological drivers of a particularly striking Neotropical-Oriental disjunct distribution in the rove beetle Bolitogyrus, a suspected Eocene relict. We integrated evidence from Eocene fossils, distributional and climate data, paleoclimate, paleogeography, and phylogenetic divergence dating to show that intercontinental dispersal of Bolitogyrus ceased in the early Eocene, consistent with the termination of conditions required by thermophilic lineages. These results provide new insight into the poorly known and short-lived Arctic forest community of the Early Eocene and its surviving lineages."
156,Does history of concussion affect current cognitive status?,A. Collie;P. Mccrory;M.

Some football studies suggest that athletes with a history of concussion display cognitive impairment relative to athletes with no history of concussion, but other studies have not been able to reproduce such findings. This study shows that there is no relation between the number of previous self reported episodes of concussion and current cognitive state, directly contradicting the findings of previous research."
157,Drug resistance in papillary RCC: from putative mechanisms to clinical practicalities,A. Brodziak;P. Sobczuk;E. Bartnik;M. Fiedorowicz;C. Porta;C. Szczylik;A. Czarnecka,Nature Reviews Urology,"Papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) is the second most common renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtype and accounts for 10–15% of all RCCs. Despite clinical need, few pharmacogenomics studies in pRCC have been performed. Moreover, current research fails to adequately include pRCC laboratory models, such as the ACHN or Caki-2 pRCC cell lines. The molecular mechanisms involved in pRCC development and drug resistance are more diverse than in clear-cell RCC, in which inactivation of VHL occurs in the majority of tumours. Drug resistance to multiple therapies in pRCC occurs via genetic alteration (such as mutations resulting in abnormal receptor tyrosine kinase activation or RALBP1 inhibition), dysregulation of signalling pathways (such as GSK3β–EIF4EBP1, PI3K–AKT and the MAPK or interleukin signalling pathways), deregulation of cellular processes (such as resistance to apoptosis or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition) and interactions between the cell and its environment (for example, through activation of matrix metalloproteinases). Improved understanding of resistance mechanisms will facilitate drug discovery and provide new effective therapies. Further studies on novel resistance biomarkers are needed to improve patient prognosis and stratification as well as drug development."
158,Drug-like properties and complete physicochemical profile of pyrazine‑2‑amidoxime: A combined multi-experimental and computational studies,A. Chylewska;M. Biedulska;A. Głębocka;E. Raczyńska;M. Makowski,Journal of Molecular Liquids,"Pyrazine‑2‑amidoxime (PAOX) is a prototypical sp2-hybridized amidoxime. Although, we described first time in details PAOX structure in solid state, the profile of PAOX behavior in aqueous solution still needs to be improved. While, acid-base properties of PAOX have been tried to define just once, the presented description was not complete and based only on the results of potentiometry during complexometric studies. The selection of method gives rise problems to observation the protonation or deprotonation processes of compound studied. Due to above, the presented studies show first time the complete description of PAOX acid-base properties by obtaining its pKa, solubility, partition (P) and distribution (D) coefficients using various methods. Among them, experiments: potentiometry; UV spectrophotometry by using Hammett's function and pH-metric titrations; cyclic voltammetry (CV) with glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and with GCE electropolymerized by poly‑l‑glycine (PGGCE); 1H NMR and theoretical calculations (DFT). Generally, combined four types of experimental and theoretical methods were used to estimate PAOX macro acidic-dissociation constants values. Moreover, log P and log D were determined spectrophotometrically and calculated also by DFT methods. No previous reports were found in the presented form regarding the complete drug-like properties, including negative together with positive values of pKa. Additionally, we proved by our electrochemical results that the quantitative analysis of PAOX do not need the special conditions of the electrode used in research. Hence, the comparison of our results to those described in the literature about analysis made for others, amidoxime derivatives."
159,Durchführung einer nahtlosen Anastomose für aortale Venengraftanschlüsse führt nicht zu einer Verbesserung des neuropsychologischen Outcomes,A. Böning;B. Bein;C. Dircksen;S. Carstensen;C. Friedrich;J. Hedderich;J. Cremer,Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,"Einleitung: Die Insertion eines nahtlosen Aortenanastomosensystems während einer Koronararterien-Bypassoperation zur Erstellung proximaler Venengraftanastomosen reduziert Manipulationen an der Aorta ascendens. Daher könnte ein solches Anastomosensystem möglicherweise das neuropsychologische Outcome von Patienten nach Bypassoperationen verbessern. Material und Methoden: 45 Patienten wurden in eine prospektiv-randomisierte Studie eingeschlossen, bei der ein kommerziell verfügbares nahtloses Anastomosensystem („Symmetry-Bypass-System Aortic Connector“, St. Jude Medical, Eschborn, Deutschland) mit konventioneller Bypasschirurgie verglichen wurde. Eine neuropsychologische Testbatterie wurde vor und 5 bis 8 Tage nach dem Eingriff angewendet, cerebrale Mikroembolien wurden mit Hilfe eines transkraniellen Dopplers (TCD) aufgezeichnet, so dass „High-intensitiy Transient Signals“ (HITS) intraoperativ gemessen werden konnten. Ergebnisse: Die Dauer des Eingriffs und der extrakorporalen Zirkulation (ECC) sowie die Anzahl distaler und proximaler Anastomosen waren nicht signifikant unterschiedlich zwischen beiden Gruppen. Auch die mittlere Anzahl der HITS während der ECC (konventionelle Gruppe 277±335, Connector-Gruppe 249±508 HITS) unterschied sich nicht signifikant. Interessanterweise wurden während der Insertion des nahtlosen Anastomosengerätes 16±15 HITS dokumentiert, während die mittlere Anzahl der HITS während der partiellen und totalen Aortenklemmung und des Öffnens der Aortenklemme 25±39 in der konventionellen Gruppe waren. In der Connectorgruppe mussten 6 von 23 Patienten aufgrund von connectorbezogenen Problemen von der Studie ausgeschlossen werden. In beiden Gruppen traten weder ein Schlaganfall noch ein Durchgangssyndrom postoperativ auf. Unterschiedliche statische Analysenmethoden der neuropsychologischen Tests zeigten ein leicht verschlechtertes neuropsychologisches Outcome in der Connectorgruppe, verglichen mit der konventionellen Gruppe. Schlussfolgerung: Der Einsatz eines „Symmetry Bypass System Aortic Connectors“ führt nicht zu einem besseren neuropsychologischen Ergebnis als eine Standard-Bypassoperation. Objective: The insertion of a sutureless aortic anastomosis (SAA) during coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) for construction of proximal vein graft anastomoses may reduce manipulations of the aorta. Thus, SAA could possibly improve the neuropsychologic outcome of patients after CABG surgery. Material and methods: 45 patients were included in a prospective, randomised study comparing a commercially available SAA (“Symmetry Bypass System Aortic Connector, St. Jude Medical, Inc., Minneapolis, USA) to conventional CABG surgery. A neuropsychological test battery was applied before and 5–8 days after surgery, cerebral microemboli were recorded using a transcranial Doppler (TCD) measuring high intensity transient signals (HITS) intraoperatively. Results: Duration of surgery, ECC (extracorporeal circulation) time and the number of distal and proximal anastomoses were not significantly different. The mean number of HITS during ECC (conv. CABG 277±335, SAA 249±508 HITS) did not differ significantly between the two groups. Interestingly, during insertion of the SAA device, a mean number of 16±15 HITS was documented, while the mean number of HITS during partial and complete clamping and declamping of the aorta was 25±39 in the conventional group. In the SAA group, 6/23 patients had to be excluded from the study due to SAA device-related problems. In both groups, no clinical apparent stroke or delirium occurred after surgery. Different statistical analyses of the neuropsychological tests (% group mean changes, 20% difference, linear regression) showed a slightly impaired neuropsychological outcome in the Connector group compared to the CABG group. Conclusion: The use of a “Symmetry Bypass System Aortic Connector” does not yield a better neurological outcome compared to a standard CABG procedure."
160,Dynamic flood modeling: combining Hurst and Gumbel's approach,A. Charpentier;D. Siba,Environmetrics,"When working on river floods—annual river levels maxima—, two approaches are usually considered: one inspired from Emil Gumbel where annual maxima are supposed to be i.i.d. and distributed according to Gumbel's distribution, and one inspired from Edwin Hurst where annual maxima are strongly dependent, and exhibit long range memory. This paper tries to solve this apparent paradox by deriving a dynamic model inspired from financial models, which does not take into account annual maxima only but also threshold exceedances. It studies the implications of such a paradox in terms of return period—a notion valid as long as the data are i.i.d—and of extremal events. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
161,Dynamic modelling and force analysis of a knuckle boom crane using screw theory,A. Cibicik;O. Egeland,Mechanism and Machine Theory,"This article presents a method for determination of dynamic reaction forces in knuckle boom cranes. The method is based on the dynamic modelling procedure, which is an extension of Kane’s equations of motion. An efficient formulation is used, where the link velocities and angular velocities are given in terms of the link twists, which makes it straightforward to describe the partial velocities and partial angular velocities as joint lines given as screws in Plücker coordinates. The method is presented in a systematic and general manner and is applicable for spatial crane-like manipulators with passive rotary joints and piston actuators. We propose a procedure for the substitution of the actual actuator wrenches with an equivalent set of wrenches applied on the actuator supports, which leads to an efficient procedure for the determination of reaction forces in passive joints. The application of screw theory to dynamic modelling and force analysis leads to an elegant and geometrically meaningful formulation. The method is implemented for a knuckle boom crane and simulation results are provided. The determined reaction forces can be used in mechanical problems as structural integrity calculations and fatigue lifetime prediction, as well as in control problems involving dry friction."
162,Dynamics of CAG repeat loci revealed by the analysis of their variability,A. Andrés;O. Lao;M. Soldevila;F. Calafell;J. Bertranpetit,Human Mutation,"In order to understand the dynamics of the expressed single tandem repeat trinucleotides (most of them involved in pathological expansion), the diversity in 10 different loci (SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, SCA8, SCA12, DRPLA, HD, KCNN3, and NCOA3) was analyzed in four major human groups (Africans, Europeans, Indians, and East Asians). The present analysis intends to disentangle population‐based from genetic‐based factors having shaped STR (trinucleotide) variation and to recognize, for each locus, the specific rate and pattern of mutation (bias toward expansion or contraction, constraints on allele size), and the footprints of selection. Population differences account for a very small part of the total variation, but a clear footprint appears of population growth after a bottleneck in all non‐African populations, giving support to the out‐of‐Africa model of modern humans. Most of the diversity is found among loci, and different dynamics are inferred for each of them. SCA2 and SCA3 follow an unrestricted stepwise mutation model, while the rest of loci are found under allele size constrictions and a bias to expansion (SCA1, SCA6, HD, and KCNN3), contraction (SCA12, DRPLA, and NCOA3), or unbiased (SCA8).

163,Dynamics of luffing motion of a flexible knuckle boom crane actuated by hydraulic cylinders,A. Cibicik;E. Pedersen;O. Egeland,Mechanism and Machine Theory,"In this paper we present a modeling procedure for a flexible knuckle boom crane, which is actuated by hydraulic cylinders and is modeled as a planar multibody system. We propose a convenient framework where both rigid body velocities and velocities caused by flexible behavior are represented as twists. Such formulation allows for using screw transformations, which leads to systematic derivations. Dynamics of a crane and mass balance of hydraulic cylinders are coupled using the bond graph method. In addition, we present a procedure for the determination of reaction forces in passive joints, which is conveniently given as an extension of the dynamic modeling procedure. Both procedures are presented in a general and systematic manner such that they can be applied for a group of planar flexible manipulators.We study the dynamics of luffing motion of a crane by numerical simulation and provide the simulation results, as well as determine the reaction forces in passive joints. The simulation results are validated by the ANSYS finite element analysis. The derived model provides a basis for design of luffing cylinders and can potentially be used for studying performance of a crane control system."
164,Econom\'etrie et Machine Learning,A. Charpentier;E. Flachaire;A. Ly,ArXiv Statistics,"Econometrics and machine learning seem to have one common goal: to construct a predictive model, for a variable of interest, using explanatory variables (or features). However, these two fields developed in parallel, thus creating two different cultures, to paraphrase Breiman (2001). The first was to build probabilistic models to describe economic phenomena. The second uses algorithms that will learn from their mistakes, with the aim, most often to classify (sounds, images, etc.). Recently, however, learning models have proven to be more effective than traditional econometric techniques (with a price to pay less explanatory power), and above all, they manage to manage much larger data. In this context, it becomes necessary for econometricians to understand what these two cultures are, what opposes them and especially what brings them closer together, in order to appropriate tools developed by the statistical learning community to integrate them into Econometric models."
165,Effect of Femoral Head Size on Metal-on-HXLPE Hip Arthroplasty Outcome in a Combined Analysis of Six National and Regional Registries,A. Allepuz;L. Havelin;T. Barber;A. Sedrakyan;S. Graves;B. Bordini;D. Hoeffel;G. Cafri;E. Paxton,The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery,"Background: HXLPE (highly cross-linked polyethylene) has greater wear resistance compared with UHMWPE (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene), which may contribute to improving the outcomes of total hip arthroplasty with a large femoral head. However, no information is available regarding the effect of femoral head size on the survivorship of HXLPE hip prostheses. The aim of the present study was to provide evidence regarding whether femoral head size has an effect on the risk of revision when an HXLPE liner is used on a metal head. Methods: A distributed health data network was developed by the ICOR (International Consortium of Orthopaedic Registries). Six national and regional registries are participating in this network: Kaiser Permanente, HealthEast, the Emilia-Romagna region in Italy, the Catalan region in Spain, Norway, and Australia. Data from each registry were standardized and provided at an aggregate level for each of the variables of interest. Patients with osteoarthritis who were forty-five to sixty-four years of age and had undergone uncemented total hip arthroplasty were included in the present study. Analyses were performed on the basis of individual patient profiles, utilizing the variables collected from each registry. The outcome of interest was the time to the first revision (for any reason). Survival probabilities and their standard errors were extracted from each registry for each unique combination of the covariates and were combined through multivariate meta-analysis utilizing linear mixed models to compare survivorship for <32-mm, 32-mm, and >32-mm femoral head sizes. Results: A total of 14,372 total hip arthroplasties were included in the study. The five-year rate of revision surgery varied from 1.9% to 3.2% among registries. The risk of revision did not differ significantly between <32-mm and 32-mm head sizes (HR [hazard ratio] = 0.91, 95% CI [confidence interval] = 0.69 to 1.19) or between >32-mm and 32-mm sizes (HR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.70 to 1.55). Conclusions: The results of our study provide relevant data to orthopaedic surgeons deciding on the use of a larger articulation in a metal-on-polyethylene bearing. A larger head diameter should not be considered a detriment to device survival when an HXLPE liner is used. However, efforts to force the use of a large-size implant appear unsupported, as similar survivorship was observed for all head diameter groups."
166,"Effect of MAP storage on chemical, physical and sensory characteristics of ""níscalos"" (Lactarius deliciosus)",A. Andrés;M. Timón;G. Molina;N. González;M. Petrón,Food Packaging and Shelf Life,"Lactarius deliciosus mushrooms were packed in two modified atmospheres: (i) batch 1 (3.7% O2 + 8.3% CO2) and (ii) batch 2 (9.0% O2 + 4.5% CO2), and compared with a control. Mushrooms were stored at 2 ± 1 °C and sampling was carried out after 0, 4, 7 and 9 days. Firmness and weight decrease were not significant during storage. Browning significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) with a higher intensity in batches 1 and 2. Polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity decreased after 7 days of storage (P &lt; 0.05) and peroxidase remained constant during the first 4 days of storage (P &gt; 0.05). Control batch exhibited the highest values for PPO (P &lt; 0.001). Polyphenol concentration in control batch remained constant (P &gt; 0.05) whereas it showed a decreasing trend for batch 1 and an increasing trend for batch 2. Visual quality, colour, texture and aroma scores, and acceptability decreased during storage. Acceptability of control samples after 9 days was higher than batches 2 and 1 (P &lt; 0.05). Finally, MAP showed a very limited bacteriostatic effect."
167,Effect of doping on transport properties of nanocrystalline CdSe thin film,A. Al-Kabbi;K. Sharma;G. Saini;S. Tripathi,Thin Solid Films,"The effect of In and Zn doping on the transport properties of nanocrystalline CdSe thin films has been investigated. Thin films are prepared by the physical vapor deposition technique. The films crystallize in a hexagonal structure with spherical particles of nanometer range having different sizes and uniformly distributed all over the surface of the substrates. The experimental data of DC electrical conductivity measurements suggest that the conduction in the high temperature range occurs in the extended states while conduction in the low temperature range takes place through a variable range hopping. The bimolecular recombination nature of the thin films has been revealed by the photoconductivity illumination dependence. The mobility lifetime product and minority carrier diffusion length of thin films have been investigated by the time of flight and steady state photocarrier grating technique respectively. The values of minority carrier diffusion length are found to be 184 nm, 107 nm and 103 nm for nc-CdSe, nc-CdSe:In and nc-CdSe:Zn thin films, respectively."

Tripathi,Journal of Alloys and Compounds,"Thin films of the undoped nanocrystalline CdSe (nc-CdSe) and doped (Zn and In) thin films have been prepared by physical vapor deposition in the presence of argon as inert gas at room temperature. The influence of the doping materials on the stoichiometry, grain size and trap parameters has been explored by means of Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and thermally stimulated current (TSC) measurements. The TEM results show that small particles of nanometer range are formed in thin films and that size increases slightly with Zn doping and decreases when In is used as the doping material. TSC measurements in the temperature range from 225 to 350 K are performed at different heating rates. Well defined TSC peaks have been observed. The peaks shift to higher temperatures as heating rate is increased. Trap parameters, such as trap depth and density of traps have been determined. The trap parameters have been evaluated by using Gaussian fit and different heating rates methods. Good agreement has been obtained between trap parameters calculated from these two methods. It is observed that the trap depth decreases and trap density increases in doped samples compared to undoped ones.Thin films of the undoped nanocrystalline CdSe (nc-CdSe) and doped (Zn and In) thin films have been prepared by physical vapor deposition in the presence of argon as inert gas at room temperature.

The TEM results show that small particles of nanometer range are formed in thin films and that size increases slightly with Zn doping and decreases when In is used as the doping material. TSC measurements in the temperature range from 225 to 350 K are performed at different heating rates. Well defined TSC peaks have been observed. The peaks shift to higher temperatures as heating rate is increased. Trap parameters, such as trap depth and density of traps have been determined. The trap parameters have been evaluated by using Gaussian fit and different heating rates methods. Good agreement has been obtained between trap parameters calculated from these two methods. It is observed that the trap depth decreases and trap density increases in doped samples compared to undoped ones.► The nanocrystalline sizes of pure and doped CdSe thin films are confirmed by TEM. ► Trap parameter were determined by the thermally stimulated currents technique. ► Different methods used to evaluate the trapping parameters from TSC curve. ► Electron trap centre decreases in doped samples compared to undoped ones. ► Density of trap has been increased after doping."
169,Effect of morphology on the superconductor-insulator transition in one-dimensional nanowires,A. Bollinger;A. Rogachev;M. Remeika;A. Bezryadin,Physical Review B,"We study the effect of morphology on the low-temperature behavior of superconducting nanowires which vary in length from 86 nm to 188 nm. A well-defined superconductor-insulator transition is observed only in the family of homogeneous wires, in which case the transition occurs when the normal resistance is close to h/4e2. Inhomogeneous wires, on the other hand, exhibit a mixed behavior, such that signatures of the superconducting and insulating regimes can be observed in the same sample. The resistance versus temperature curves of inhomogeneous wires show multiple steps, each corresponding to a weak link constriction (WLC) present in the wire. Similarly, each WLC generates a differential resistance peak when the bias current reaches the critical current of the WLC. Due to the presence of WLC’s an inhomogeneous wire splits into a sequence of weakly interacting segments where each segment can act as a superconductor or as an insulator. Thus the entire wire then shows a mixed behavior."
170,Effect of production season on protein fraction content in milk of various breeds of goats in Poland,A. Brodziak;J. Król;J. Barłowska;Z. Litwińczuk,International Journal of Dairy Technology,"Milk of various goat breeds was analysed to assess the effect of production season on content of basic chemical components, with regard to whey proteins. Milk of goats in the productive herds (white and coloured coat) contained significantly (P < 0.01) more total protein, casein, fat, dry matter and functional whey proteins. The production season significantly determined the content of total protein (P < 0.01), casein (P < 0.01) and whey proteins (P < 0.05), including α‐lactalbumin (P < 0.01) and lactoferrin (P < 0.01). A higher content of total protein and casein was found in the autumn–winter season and the content of whey proteins was higher in the spring–summer period."
171,Effectiveness of physical activity interventions for older adults: a review1,A. Bij;M. Laurant;M. Wensing,American Journal of Preventive Medicine,"Objective: This review evaluates the effectiveness of physical activity interventions among older adults.Methods: Computerized searches were performed to identify randomized controlled trials. Studies were included if: (1) the study population consisted of older adults (average sample population age of ≥50 years and minimum age of 40 years); (2) the intervention consisted of an exercise program or was aimed at promoting physical activity; and (3) reported on participation (i.e., adherence/compliance) or changes in level of physical activity (e.g., pre-post test measures and group comparisons).Results: The 38 studies included 57 physical activity interventions. Three types of interventions were identified: home-based, group-based, and educational. In the short-term, both home-based interventions and group-based interventions achieved high rates of participation (means of 90% and 84%, respectively). Participation declined the longer the duration of the intervention. Participation in education interventions varied widely (range of 35% to 96%). Both group-based interventions and education interventions were effective in increasing physical activity levels in the short-term. Information on long-term effectiveness was either absent or showed no difference of physical activity level between the study groups.Conclusions: Home-based, group-based, and educational physical activity interventions can result in increased physical activity, but changes are small and short-lived. Participation rates of home-based and group-based interventions were comparable, and both seemed to be unrelated to type or frequency of physical activity. The beneficial effect of behavioral reinforcement strategies was not evident. Comparative studies evaluating the effectiveness of diverse interventions are needed to identify the interventions most likely to succeed in the initiation and maintenance of physical activity.Objective: This review evaluates the effectiveness of physical activity interventions among older adults.Methods: Computerized searches were performed to identify randomized controlled trials.

172,Effects of Estrogen on Global Gene Expression: Identification of Novel Targets of Estrogen Action,A. Charpentier;A. Bednarek;R. Daniel;K. Hawkins;K. Laflin;S. Gaddis;M. Macleod;C. Aldaz,Cancer Research,"The important role played by the sex hormone estrogen in disease andphysiological processes has been well documented. However, themechanisms by which this hormone elicits many of its normal as well aspathological effects are unclear. To identify both known and unknowngenes that are regulated by or associated with estrogen action, weperformed serial analysis of gene expression on estrogen-responsivebreast cancer cells after exposure to this hormone. We examinedapproximately 190,000 mRNA transcripts and monitored the expressionbehavior of 12,550 genes. Expression levels for the vast majority ofthose transcripts were observed to remain constant upon 17β estradiol(E2) treatment. Only approximately 0.4% of the genesshowed an increase in expression of ≥3-fold by 3 hpost-E2 treatment. We cloned five novel genes(E2IG1-5), which were observedup-regulated by the hormonal treatment. Of these the most highlyinduced transcript, E2IG1, appears to be a novel memberof the family of small heat shock proteins. The E2IG4gene is a new member of the large family of leucine-richrepeat-containing proteins. On the basis of architectural and domainhomology, this gene appears to be a good candidate for secretion in theextracellular environment and, therefore, may play a role in breasttissue remodeling and/or epithelium-stroma interactions. Severalinteresting genes with a potential role in the regulation of cell cycleprogression were also identified to increase in expression, includingPescadillo and chaperonin CCT2. Twoputative paracrine/autocrine factors of potential importance in theregulation of the growth of breast cancer cells were identified to behighly up-regulated by E2: stanniocalcin 2, acalcium/phosphate homeostatic hormone; and inhibin-β B, aTGF-β-like factor. Interestingly, we also determined thatE2IG1 and stanniocalcin 2 wereexclusively overexpressed in estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancerlines, and thus they have the potential to serve as breast cancerbiomarkers. This data provides a comprehensive view of the changesinduced by E2 on the transcriptional program ofhuman E2-responsive cells, and it also identifies novel andpreviously unsuspected gene targets whose expression is affected bythis hormone."
173,Effects of pleasant-activities manipulation on depression.,A. Biglan;D. Craker,Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology,"Examined the effects on mood of increasing pleasant activities in a series of 4 withdrawal designs with 4 clinically depressed females, aged 19–46 yrs. (Depression was confirmed through instruments including the MMPI Depression scale and Beck Depression Inventory). Ss were taught daily goal setting and self-reward strategies for increasing pleasant activities. Goal setting had no impact on self-monitored pleasant-activity rate. Self-reward was associated with a modest increase in activity rate when it was first introduced, and it produced a substantial increase in pleasant activities when it was reinstated following a 10-day withdrawal. However, these increases produced no improvement in self-monitored mood. (5 ref)"
174,Effects of re-curing on microstructure of concrete after high temperature exposure,A. Akca;N. Özyurt,Construction and Building Materials,"Concrete contains many phases such as ettringite, portlandite, C-S-H etc. which undergo phase changes by forming some active products such as lime and calcium silicates during heating. These new active phases give reactions with water and carbon dioxide in air and affect the residual properties of concrete after subsequent days of cooling. In order to understand better these phase changes and their effects on residual properties, 3 different types of concrete were produced depending on mineral admixture type. Concrete specimens were heated to 1000 °C and one face heating procedure was applied in the furnace. Then concrete specimens were subjected to air and water re-curing processes. Microstructural investigations XRD, TGA and SEM/EDX were conducted on the samples obtained from concrete specimens."
175,Effects of re-curing on residual mechanical properties of concrete after high temperature exposure,A. Akca;N. Özyurt,Construction and Building Materials,"Physical and mechanical changes in concrete continue in subsequent days of heating since some chemically active products in concrete give reactions with water and carbon dioxide in air and new formations determine the fate of concrete. Therefore, this study was conducted to understand the effects of mineral admixtures, fiber reinforcement, air entrainment and different re-curing regimes (after heating) on residual properties of concrete. Concrete specimens were heated to 1000 °C then water and air re-curing processes were applied on heated specimens and further deterioration and recovery of concrete were evaluated. New cracks occurred on the heated surfaces during air re-curing period and reduction in mechanical properties was observed while water re-cured specimens kept their stabilities and regain in their mechanical properties was obtained. Moreover, micro level investigations were conducted on heated surfaces of air re-cured and water re-cured concrete specimens for understanding the reasons of changes observed in mechanical properties."

Barrick,Veterinary Parasitology,"A study was conducted in cattle experimentally infested with Psoroptes ovis to compare the prophylactic control against P. ovis provided by a long-acting injectable formulation of ivermectin to that of a commercially available injectable formulation of doramectin. Thirty Holstein steers were used. Animals were allocated by restricted randomization based on Day 0 body weight, forming six replicates of five animals each. Within each replicate, one animal was randomly allocated to one of the following treatment groups, with ivermectin and doramectin administered subcutaneously where indicated: (1) untreated controls; (2) ivermectin long-acting injectable (LAI) 630 mcg/kg, 56 days before challenge; (3) ivermectin LAI 630 mcg/kg, 42 days before challenge; (4) ivermectin LAI 630 mcg/kg, 35 days before challenge; or (5) doramectin 200 mcg/kg, 35 days before challenge. Animals were housed in individual pens 1 week prior to treatment. All animals were experimentally infested with P. ovis mites in the area between the shoulders, on the same day. Live mites were counted in scrapings from mange lesions at 2 sites on each animal 14, 21 and 28 days after challenge. Live mites were found in 33, 67 and 83% of the untreated controls on each respective evaluation. No P. ovis mites were found in steers treated with ivermectin LAI. Those animals showed lower (P&lt;0.05) mite counts than untreated controls on evaluations conducted 21 and 28 days after challenge. These results indicate that the ivermectin long-acting injectable formulation prevents induced infestations by P. ovis for at least 56 days after treatment.

177,Electoral Rules and Political Selection: Theory and Evidence from a Field Experiment in Afghanistan,A. Beath;F. Christia;G. Egorov;R. Enikolopov,Review of Economic Studies,"Voters commonly face a choice between competent candidates and those with policy preferences similar to their own. This article explores how electoral rules, such as district magnitude, mediate this trade-off and affect the composition of representative bodies and the quality of policy outcomes. We show formally that anticipation of bargaining over policy causes voters in elections with multiple single-member districts to prefer candidates with polarized policy positions over more competent candidates. Results from a unique field experiment in Afghanistan are consistent with these predictions. Specifically, representatives selected by elections with a single multi-member district are better educated and exhibit less extreme policy preferences."
178,Electoral Rules and the Quality of Politicians: Theory and Evidence from a Field Experiment in Afghanistan,A. Beath;F. Christia;G. Egorov;R. Enikolopov,NBER Working Papers,"We examine the effect of electoral rules on the quality of elected officials using a unique field experiment which induced randomized variation in the method of council elections in 250 villages in Afghanistan. In particular, we compare at-large elections, with a single multi-member district, to district elections, with multiple single member districts. We propose a theoretical model where the difference in the quality of elected officials between the two electoral systems occurs because elected legislators have to bargain over policy, which induces citizens in district elections to vote strategically for candidates with more polarized policy positions even at the expense of candidates' competence. Consistent with the predictions of the model, we find that elected officials in at-large elections are more educated than those in district elections and that this effect is stronger in more heterogeneous villages. We also find evidence that elected officials in district elections have more biased preferences."
179,Electric Field Effects on Absorption and Fluorescence Spectra of Trimethylsilyl- and Trimethylsilylethynyl-Substituted Compounds of Pyrene in a PMMA Film,A. Ara;T. Iimori;T. Nakabayashi;H. Maeda;K. Mizuno;N. Ohta,Journal of Physical Chemistry B,"External electric field effects on absorption and fluorescence spectra of 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)pyrene and 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(trimethylsilylethynyl)pyrene (TMSPy and TMS(E)Py, respectively) have been examined in a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) film at various concentrations at various temperatures. TMS(E)Py preferentially forms an aggregate in a PMMA film, as the concentration increases, indicating that the acetylenic groups enhance the π−π interactions between pyrene molecules. The change in molecular polarizability following excitation has been determined both for the monomer and for the aggregate, based on the electroabsorption spectra. The change in molecular polarizability following emission has also been determined in both compounds, based on the electrofluorescence spectra. TMSPy exhibits two excimer fluorescence emissions at high concentrations which are ascribed to the partially overlapping excimer and the sandwich-type excimer, respectively, besides the monomer fluorescence emitted from the locally excited state. The sandwich-type excimer fluorescence as well as monomer fluorescence is quenched by an electric field, whereas the fluorescence of the partially overlapping excimer is enhanced by an electric field. Excimer fluorescence of TMS(E)Py, which arises from the sandwich-type excimer, is quenched by an electric field at any temperature. Only one species of the partially overlapping excimer is confirmed in TMSPy, while no partially overlapping excimer is confirmed in TMS(E)Py."
180,Electro-Optics of Conventional and Inverted Thick Junction Organic Solar Cells,A. Armin;A. Yazmaciyan;M. Hambsch;J. Li;P. Burn;P. Meredith,ACS Photonics,"Bulk heterojunctions continue to be the dominant architecture for solution processed organic solar cells. In general, photoactive films on the order of 100 nm thickness have delivered the highest power conversion efficiencies. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that thicker junctions are needed for high yield, high throughput, low cost manufacturing of commercial organic solar cells. Very few organic semiconductors are suitable for maintaining optimal efficiencies in cells with thicker junctions. This paradigm is beginning to shift with the recent high mobility donor polymers, where electrically inverted thick heterojunction structures deliver impressive efficiencies. The inverted architecture seems to be an essential feature of these solar cells. The reason for this has yet to be explained, and in this work, we address this question. We present analytical simulations and experimental evidence showing how the charge generation and extraction physics is significantly different in thin and thick heterojunctions, inverted and conventional. In particular, our predictive model shows how the inverted architecture compensates for strongly imbalanced carrier mobilities, which would otherwise cause debilitating recombination. Thick bulk heterojunctions can be designed to deliver high efficiencies, but for high mobility donors, this is only in an inverted architecture. These findings have profound implications for manufacturing of commercial organic solar cells."
181,Empowering Women through Development Aid: Evidence from a Field Experiment in Afghanistan,A. Beath;F. Christia;R. Enikolopov,American Political Science Review,"In societies with widespread gender discrimination, development programs with gender quotas are considered a way to improve women's economic, political, and social status. Using a randomized field experiment across 500 Afghan villages, we examine the effects of a development program that mandates female participation. We find that even in a highly conservative context like Afghanistan, such initiatives improve outcomes specific to female participation in some economic, social, and political activities, including increased mobility and income generation. They, however, produce no change in more entrenched female roles linked to family decision-making or in attitudes toward the general role of women in society."

184,Energetic and Exergetic Performances of Plate Heat Exchanger Using Brine-Based Hybrid Nanofluid for Milk Chilling Application,A. Bhattad;J. Sarkar;P. Ghosh,Heat Transfer Engineering,"Theoretical study on the energetic and exergetic performances of a counter-flow corrugated plate heat exchanger using hybrid nanofluids for the milk chilling application has been done in the present investigation. Magnesia-silver and Alumina-silver nanoparticles have been dispersed in the ethylene glycol–water mixture and propylene glycol–water mixture (20:80 brine solutions) with different particle volume concentration separately. Effect of particle volume concentration and flow rate of the hybrid nanofluid on the heat transfer rate, convective, and overall heat transfer coefficients, mass flow rate of milk, pressure drop, pumping power, entropy generation rate, second law efficiency, irreversibility, irreversibility distribution ratio, non-dimensional exergy (NDE) destruction, and performance index have been studied. It has been observed that heat transfer rate, convective and overall heat transfer coefficients, pressure drop, pumping power, irreversibility, entropy generation rate, second law efficiency, and milk flow rate increase; while NDE destruction, performance index, and irreversibility distribution ratio decrease with the hybrid nanofluid flow rate and the volume concentration of the nanofluid. Within studied ranges, the hybrid nanofluid yields the maximum improvement of heat transfer rate and convective heat transfer coefficient of about 1.6% and 9.4%, respectively, compared to base fluid. It has also been found that silver + alumina shows slightly better performance improvement and hence hybrid nanofluid is recommended as a suitable alternative for the milk chilling units."
185,Energy consumption reduction in CO2 capturing and sequestration of an LNG plant through process integration and waste heat utilization,A. Alabdulkarem;Y. Hwang;R. Radermacher,International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control,"Liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants are energy intensive. As a result, the power plants operating these LNG plants emit high amounts of CO2. To mitigate global warming that is caused by the increase in atmospheric CO2, CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS) using amine absorption is proposed. However, the major challenge of implementing this CCS system is the associated power requirement, increasing energy consumption by about 15–20%. In order to reduce such energy consumption, innovative process integration and waste heat utilization is proposed. Four waste heat sources and six potential uses were uncovered. A new integrated CCS configuration is proposed, which integrates the APCI LNG plant and the driver cycle with the CCS plant. HYSYS simulation software was used to simulate the CO2 capture cycle using monoethanolamine solvent, natural gas combined cycles, CO2 compression cycle and CO2 liquefaction cycles. The developed models were validated against experimental data from the literature with good agreement. Net available power enhancement in one of the proposed CCS configuration is 26.3 MW, which is 16.31% more than the conventional CCS configuration. Pinch analysis method was used to compare the utility cooling and utility heating of the proposed and conventional CCS configurations. The result of the pinch analysis shows that the proposed CCS configuration requires 23.86% less utility cooling than the conventional CCS configuration.Liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants are energy intensive.

186,Energy-Economic Analysis of Plate Evaporator using Brine-based Hybrid Nanofluids as Secondary Refrigerant,A. Bhattad;J. Sarkar;P. Ghosh,International Journal of Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration,"Energy and economic analyses of corrugated plate evaporator have been performed in this study by using brine-based hybrid nanofluids as secondary refrigerant for low temperature applications (milk chilling, ice making and fish freezing). Various hybrid nanofluids containing alumina with different nanoparticles (copper, silver and multi walled carbon nanotube) dispersed in ethylene glycol/water, propylene glycol/water, calcium chloride/water and potassium acetate/water brines have been considered. A comparison has been made based on overall heat transfer coefficient, evaporator size (heat transfer area), pump work, COP, annual cost and payback period. The maximum reduction in heat transfer area has been observed for PG brine-based alumina–silver hybrid nanofluid. Whereas, the maximum reduction in pump work and augmentation in COP have been obtained for PG brine-based alumina–MWCNT hybrid nanofluid. EG brine-based Alumina–Cu hybrid nanofluid yields minimum annual cost. Most of the nanofluids (except PG brine-based Al2O3–Ag nanofluid) seem to be not beneficial for practical use due to comparatively long payback period; however, that can be significantly reduced in future by decreasing nanoparticle cost and increasing nanofluid stability. The present study reveals that the brine-based hybrid nanofluids may be the potential option as next generation secondary refrigerants for low temperature applications."
187,Enforced adenoviral vector-mediated expression of HOXB4 in human umbilical cord blood cd34+ cells promotes myeloid differentiation but not proliferation,A. Brun;X. Fan;J. Björnsson;R. Humphries;S. Karlsson,Molecular Therapy,"Retroviral overexpression of the transcription factor HOXB4 results in a rapid increase in proliferation of murine hematopoietic stem cells both in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, we asked whether transient overexpression of HOXB4 would increase proliferation of human primitive hematopoietic progenitors. Transient overexpression of HOXB4 was generated in umbilical cord blood (CB) CD34+ cells by a recombinant adenovirus (AdHOXB4) expressing HOXB4 together with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP). Transduced, GFP+ cells were cultured in serum-free medium containing cytokines that primarily support the growth of primitive hematopoietic progenitors. In contrast to previous findings using retroviral overexpression of HOXB4, we did not observe any increase in proliferation of primitive progenitors or increased colony formation of clonogenic progenitors, including progenitor progeny from long-term culture-initiating cells following adenoviral vector overexpression of HOXB4 in CB CD34+ cells. However, enforced expression of HOXB4 by the adenoviral vector significantly increased myeloid differentiation of primitive hematopoietic progenitors. Since retroviral vectors generate low and continuous levels of transgene expression in contrast to the high, transient levels generated by the adenoviral vector, our findings suggest that the high levels of HOXB4 expression generated by AdHOXB4 in human CB CD34+ cells direct the cells toward a myeloid differentiation program rather than increased proliferation."
188,Engineered self-assembling monolayers for label free detection of influenza nucleoprotein,A. Brun;A. Soliakov;D. Shah;S. Holt;A. Mcgill;J. Lakey,Biomedical Microdevices,"Integrating nanotechnology into useable devices requires a combination of bottom up and top down methodology. Often the techniques to measure and control these different components are entirely different, so methods that can analyse the nanoscale component in situ are of increasing importance. Here we describe a strategy that employs a self-assembling monolayer of engineered protein chimeras to display an array of oriented antibodies (IgG) on a microelectronic device for the label free detection of influenza nucleoprotein. The structural and functional properties of the bio-interface were characterised by a range of physical techniques including surface plasmon resonance, quartz-crystal microbalance and neutron reflectometry. This combination of methods reveals a 13.5 nm thick engineered-monolayer that (i) self-assembles on gold surfaces, (ii) captures IgG with high affinity in a defined orientation and (iii) specifically recognises the influenza A nucleoprotein. Furthermore we also show that this non-covalent self-assembled structure can render the dissociation of bound IgG irreversible by chemical crosslinking in situ without affecting the IgG function. The methods can thus describe in detail the transition from soluble engineered molecules with nanometre dimensions to an array that demonstrates the principles of a working influenza sensor."

Chorkendorff,Nano Letters,"Nanoparticle engineering for catalytic applications requires both a synthesis technique for the production of well-defined nanoparticles and measurements of their catalytic performance. In this paper, we present a new approach to rationally engineering highly active Ni–Mo–S nanoparticle catalysts for hydrodesulfurization (HDS), i.e., the removal of sulfur from fossil fuels. Nanoparticle catalysts are synthesized by the sputtering of a Mo75Ni25 metal target in a reactive atmosphere of Ar and H2S followed by the gas aggregation of the sputtered material into nanoparticles. The nanoparticles are filtered by a quadrupole mass filter and subsequently deposited on a planar substrate, such as a grid for electron microscopy or a microreactor. By varying the mass of the deposited nanoparticles, it is demonstrated that the Ni–Mo–S nanoparticles can be tuned into fullerene-like particles, flat-lying platelets, and upright-oriented platelets. The nanoparticle morphologies provide different abundances of Ni–Mo–S edge sites, which are commonly considered the catalytically important sites. Using a microreactor system, we assess the catalytic activity of the Ni–Mo–S nanoparticles for the HDS of dibenzothiophene. The measurements show that platelets are twice as active as the fullerene-like particles, demonstrating that the Ni–Mo–S edges are more active than basal planes for the HDS. Furthermore, the upright-standing orientation of platelets show an activity that is six times higher than the fullerene-like particles, demonstrating the importance of the edge site number and accessibility to reducing, e.g., sterical hindrance for the reacting molecules."
190,Engineering dielectric constants in organic semiconductors,A. Armin;D. Stoltzfus;J. Donaghey;A. Clulow;R. Nagiri;P. Burn;I. Gentle;P. Meredith,Journal of Materials Chemistry C,"The dielectric properties of three pairs of organic semiconductors that contain increasing numbers of cyclopentadithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole moieties (monomer, dimer and polymer) were studied and compared. The materials in each pair differed in the nature of the ‘solubilizing groups’, which are either alkyl- or glycol-based. At low frequencies (i.e., single component) solar cells comprising the dimer and polymer glycolated materials both showed measurable improvements at wavelengths close to their optical gap when compared with the alkylated equivalents. The improvement is suggestive of an increase in the charge generation efficiency, potentially facilitated by the high optical-frequency dielectric constant."

Vaglini,Computers and Operations Research,"Recent miniaturization in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) technology encourages the use of many small UAVs for search missions in unknown environments, provided that the autonomous and adaptive coordination logic can be effective. In this research field, biologically inspired metaheuristics have been proposed to mimics swarms, flocks, and other coordination schemas. The design and management of such systems is a research challenge when considering (i) combination and optimization of multiple metaheuristics and (ii) enhancements of biologically inspired metaheuristic through technological advances. In this paper the swarm coordination of UAVs employed in target search is based on flocking and stigmergy, to provide robust formation control and dynamic environmental information sharing, respectively. The design of both metaheuristics takes into account UAVs equipment, and the coordination logic is adapted to the mission by means of a differential evolutionary algorithm. This algorithm optimizes the aggregated structural parameters of all metaheuristics to allow the most efficient coordination with respect to the mission environment. Some possible enhancements of stigmergy are studied by simulating target search tasks on synthetic and real-world scenarios."
192,Enhancing the thermal comfort of fabrics for the footwear industry,A. Borreguero;B. Talavera;J. Rodriguez;J. Valverde;J. Gonzalez;M. Carmona,Textile Research Journal,"A nonwoven fabric, three foams and leather, commonly used as fabrics for shoe manufacturing, were doped with microcapsules containing phase change materials (PCMs) and also with carbon nanofibers (CNFs) in order to improve the thermal comfort provided by the shoes. The maximum microcapsule content that can be incorporated and the influence on the weight, thickness and the thermal properties and behavior of the fabrics were evaluated. The resulting materials showed a thermal energy storage (TES) capacity up to 13.74 J/g and a maximum thickness increase of the composite fabric of 0.6 mm. The PCMs addition promoted a slight modification of the steady-state temperatures of the fabrics subjected to heating or cooling processes and the stored and released heats confirmed that PCMs work in a reversible way. On the other hand, the addition of CNFs compensated for the insulating effect of the PCMs. Finally, it was found that footwear containing these materials could hold the foot temperature for a longer time than parent fabrics."
193,Er3+/Yb3+-activated silica–titania planar waveguides for EDPWAs fabricated by rf-sputtering,A. Chiasera;C. Tosello;E. Moser;M. Montagna;M. Ferrari,Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids,"Two Er3+/Yb3+-codoped 92SiO2–8TiO2 planar waveguides, with 1.2 mol% Er and molar ratio Er/Yb of 2, were fabricated by rf-sputtering technique. The active films were deposited on silica-on-silicon and silica glass substrates. The thickness of the waveguides and the refractive index at 632.8 and 543.5 nm were measured by an m-line apparatus. The losses, for the TE0 mode, were evaluated at 632.8 and 1300 nm. The structural properties were investigated by energy dispersive spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. All waveguides were single-mode at 1550 nm. An attenuation coefficient of 0.5 dB/cm at 632.8 nm and 0.1 dB/cm at 1300 nm were measured. The emission at 1530 nm of the 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition of Er3+ ion was observed at room temperature upon continuous wave excitation at 981 and 514.5 nm. Back energy transfer from Er3+ to Yb3+ was demonstrated by measurement of Yb3+ emission upon Er3+ excitation at 514.5 nm. Effective excitation efficiency of Er3+ ions by co-doping with Yb3+ ions was shown by photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy."

195,Establishing the Stages and Processes of Change for Weight Loss by Consensus of Experts,A. Andrés;C. Saldaña;J. Gómez‐Benito,Obesity,"The present study aimed to establish, by a consensus of experts, the stages and processes of change for weight management in overweight and obese people. The first step involved developing two questionnaires aimed at assessing stages and processes of change for weight loss in overweight and obese people. The processes‐of‐change questionnaire consisted of 12 subscales, and contained 107 items. A three‐round Delphi study was carried out through a website, where participants were asked to give their opinion about the representativeness and clarity of the scale items. The stages‐of‐change questionnaire consisted of five items and was presented in the final round of the study. A team of 66 experts in the obesity field from 29 countries participated in the study. They were selected either because they belonged to the organizing committee of international associations related to obesity, or because of their research career. The required changes in the questionnaire were made according to the opinions of the participants. Some of these were the result of the group statistical response, whereas others were due to the suggestions made by the participants. A final version of the questionnaire consisting of 63 items was eventually obtained. The present study produced two questionnaires to assess stages and processes of change for weight management. The strength of the study lies in the consensus reached by the panel of experts in order to establish the required content of the questionnaires. The two measures provide useful tools for practitioners who wish to tailor weight‐management interventions according to transtheoretical model constructs."
196,Estimated dietary intake of nitrate and nitrite from meat consumed in Fiji,A. Chetty;S. Prasad;O. Pinho;C. Morais,Food Chemistry,"To assess the risk posed by meat consumption to the Fiji and Pacific populace, the present study reports nitrate and nitrite in meat. Twelve commercially available meat products, with a total of 210 fresh and processed meat samples, were analysed for nitrate and nitrite by an optimised RP-HPLC technique with isocratic elution using n-octylamine in 20.0% methanol at pH 6.60. The nitrate content in the meat samples ranged from 0.00 to 124 mg kg−1 whereas the nitrite ranged from 0.00 to 164 mg kg−1. The study shows that the nitrate and nitrite contents of meat samples in Fiji were below the maximum level proposed by European Union legislation but above the limit set by Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ). The estimated dietary intake of nitrate and nitrite was calculated from a 24-h diet recall study as well as from Fiji’s food balance sheets."

198,Evaluation of stochastic global optimization methods for modeling vapor–liquid equilibrium data,A. Bonilla-Petriciolet;G. Rangaiah;J. Segovia-Hernández,Fluid Phase Equilibria,"Parameter estimation for vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE) data modeling plays an important role in design, optimization and control of separation units. This optimization problem is very challenging due to the high non-linearity of thermodynamic models. Recently, several stochastic optimization methods such as Differential Evolution with Tabu List (DETL) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) have evolved as alternative and reliable strategies for solving global optimization problems including parameter estimation in thermodynamic models. However, these methods have not been applied and compared with respect to other stochastic strategies such as Simulated Annealing (SA), Differential Evolution (DE) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) in the context of parameter estimation for VLE data modeling. Therefore, in this study several stochastic optimization methods are applied to solve parameter estimation problems for VLE modeling using both the classical least squares and maximum likelihood approaches. Specifically, we have tested and compared the reliability and efficiency of SA, GA, DE, DETL and PSO for modeling several binary VLE data using local composition models. These methods were also tested on benchmark problems for global optimization. Our results show that the effectiveness of these stochastic methods varies significantly between the different tested problems and also depends on the stopping criterion especially for SA, GA and PSO. Overall, DE and DETL have better performance for solving the parameter estimation problems in VLE data modeling.Parameter estimation for vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE) data modeling plays an important role in design, optimization and control of separation units.

199,Evidence for miR-548c-5p regulation of FOXC2 transcription through a distal genomic target site in human podocytes,A. Christofides;G. Papagregoriou;H. Dweep;N. Makrides;N. Gretz;K. Felekkis;C. Deltas,Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences,"Podocytes are highly differentiated epithelial cells outlining the glomerular vessels. FOXC2 is a transcription factor essential for inducing podocyte differentiation, development and maturation, and is considered to be the earliest podocyte marker. miRNA prediction analysis revealed a full-length target site for the primate-specific miR-548c-5p at a genomic region &gt; 8 kb upstream of FOXC2. We hypothesised that the transcription rates of FOXC2 during podocyte differentiation might be tuned by miR-548c-5p through this target site. Experiments were performed with cultured human podocytes, transfected with luciferase reporter constructs bearing this target site region within an enhancer element of the native plasmid. The results confirmed a seed region-driven targeting potential by the miRNA, with mimics downregulating and inhibitors enhancing luciferase activity. Introducing mutations into the miRNA target seed region abolished the expected response. In cultured podocytes, FOXC2 mRNA and protein levels responded to miR-548c-5p abundance in a coordinated manner before and after induction of differentiation, with high statistical significance. Ago-ChIP experiments revealed occupancy of the miRNA target site by miRNA/RISC in undifferentiated cells and its release when differentiation is initiated, allowing its interaction with the gene’s promoter region to amplify FOXC2 expression, as shown by chromosome conformation capture and qRT-PCR. Moreover, the expression pattern of FOXC2 during podocyte differentiation seems to be affected by miR-548c-5p, as removal of either endogenous or mimic miR-548c-5p results in increased FOXC2 protein levels and cells resembling those undergoing differentiation. Collectively, results indicate a well-orchestrated regulatory model of FOXC2 expression by a remote upstream target site for miR-548c-5p."
200,Evidence in development of sustainability reporting: a case of a developing country,A. Amran;R. Haniffa,Business Strategy and the Environment,"Current development in social accounting presents an interesting phenomenon. Companies are increasingly engaging in sustainability initiatives and reporting their activities in annual reports, company websites and other media of communication. Unlike previous studies, which have mainly used ex post content analysis of annual reports or other published data to study the relationship between disclosure and possible determinants, this study starts with an interview with the local preparer before the data is triangulated to determine the significant possible determinants. The interview findings are interpreted through institutional theory for possible identification of determinants. Initially, the interview findings indicate that all three mechanisms of isomorphism, the coercive, the normative and the mimetic, contribute to Malaysian company sustainability reporting. However, the regression results prove that only a government linked company in the plantation industry, which is large in size, has a significant amount of sustainability reporting.

201,Evidence of instantaneous dynamic triggering during the seismic sequence of year 2000 in south Iceland,A. Antonioli;M. Belardinelli;A. Bizzarri;K. Vogfjord,Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth,"[1] We analyze the coseismic stress perturbation during the 17 June 2000 south Iceland seismic sequence; the main shock (Ms 6.6) was followed by three large events within a few tens of seconds (8, 26, and 30 s) located within 80 km. The aim of this paper is to investigate short‐term fault interaction and instantaneous triggering. This happens when a fault perturbed by a stress change fails before the end of the transient stress perturbation. We compute the shear, normal, and Coulomb stress changes as functions of time in a stratified elastic half‐space by using discrete wave number and reflectivity methods. We calculate dynamic stresses caused by the main shock at the hypocenters of these three subsequent events. Our numerical results show that the onset of the last two events is slightly delayed with respect to the arrival time of the second positive peak of Coulomb stress variation, while the first event occurred after the first positive stress peak. We have also analyzed the response of a spring slider system representing a fault governed by a rate‐ and state‐dependent friction law, perturbed by shear and normal stress variations caused by the main shock. The fault response to the computed stress perturbations is always clock advanced. We have found suitable constitutive parameters of the modeled fault that allow the instantaneous dynamic triggering of these three earthquakes. If the initial sliding velocity is comparable with the tectonic loading velocity, we obtained failure times close to the observed origin times for low values of the initial effective normal stress."
202,Evidence supporting a role for astrocytes in the regulation of cognitive flexibility and neuronal oscillations through the Ca2+ binding protein S100β,A. Brockett;G. Kane;P. Monari;B. Briones;P. Vigneron;G. Barber;A. Bermudez;U. Dieffenbach;A. Kloth;T. Buschman;E. Gould,PLOS ONE (Research and Analysis Methods),"The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is important for cognitive flexibility, the ability to switch between two task-relevant dimensions. Changes in neuronal oscillations and alterations in the coupling across frequency ranges have been correlated with attention and cognitive flexibility. Here we show that astrocytes in the mPFC of adult male Sprague Dawley rats, participate in cognitive flexibility through the astrocyte-specific Ca2+ binding protein S100β, which improves cognitive flexibility and increases phase amplitude coupling between theta and gamma oscillations. We further show that reduction of astrocyte number in the mPFC impairs cognitive flexibility and diminishes delta, alpha and gamma power. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ signaling in the mPFC enhances cognitive flexibility, while inactivation of endogenous S100β among chemogenetically activated astrocytes in the mPFC prevents this improvement. Collectively, our work suggests that astrocytes make important contributions to cognitive flexibility and that they do so by releasing a Ca2+ binding protein which in turn enhances coordinated neuronal oscillations."
203,Evolving Prosocial and Sustainable Neighborhoods and Communities,A. Biglan;E. Hinds,Annual Review of Clinical Psychology,"In this review, we examine randomized controlled trials of community interventions to affect health. The evidence supports the efficacy of community interventions for preventing tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use; several recent trials have shown the benefits of community interventions for preventing multiple problems of young people, including antisocial behavior. However, the next generation of community intervention research needs to reflect more fully the fact that most psychological and behavioral problems of humans are interrelated and result from the same environmental conditions. The evidence supports testing new comprehensive community interventions that focus on increasing nurturance in communities. Nurturing communities will be ones in which families, schools, neighborhoods, and workplaces ( a ) minimize biologically and socially toxic events, ( b ) richly reinforce prosocial behavior, and ( c ) foster psychological acceptance. Such interventions also have the potential to make neighborhoods more sustainable."
204,Expansion of Natural Na+– and Ca2+–Montmorillonites in the Presence of NaCl and Surfactant Solutions,A. Cosultchi;G. Odriozola;A. Moctezuma;V. Lara,Energy & Fuels,"Two natural smectites, Na+– and Ca2+–montmorillonites, were contacted with NaCl solutions at concentrations between 0.05 and 0.70 mol/L; further, KCl as a swelling inhibitor and an alkylamido betaine and α-olefin sulfonate mixture used as a foaming surfactant for the water alternating gas (WAG) process were added separately to the saline solutions. The mean crystalline swelling and the distribution of the particle thickness arranged as a pile of sheets and oriented perpendicular to the 001 diffraction direction were calculated from the X-ray diffractograms and according to literature methods; the mean crystalline swelling was tested against Monte Carlo molecular simulation results from our previous works. Distribution of the clay particle thickness indicates the fuzziness of the transition between the crystalline and osmotic swelling; this method clearly shows the presence of osmotic swelling not detected on the basis of the other methods. The degree of osmotic swelling depends upon the nature of clay; it is more evident for Ca2+–montmorillonite, especially in the presence of KCl and the selected surfactant. The results are oriented to improve the selection of water salinity and type of surfactant for the WAG recovery process."

206,Experimentation on effect of particle ratio on hydrothermal performance of plate heat exchanger using hybrid nanofluid,A. Bhattad;J. Sarkar;P. Ghosh,Applied Thermal Engineering,"To foster energetic and exergetic performances of counter flow corrugated plate heat exchanger, several experiments were conducted using Al2O3–MWCNT hybrid nanofluids as coolant. The Al2O3–MWCNT hybrid nanofluids with different nanoparticle volume ratios (5:0, 4:1, 3:2, 2:3, 1:4 and 0:5) and 0.01 v% concentration were used as a coolant for sub-ambient temperature application. Operating parameters which were varied are the coolant flow rate ranging from 2.0-4.0 lpm and coolant inlet temperature from 10-25°C. Effects on heat transfer coefficient, heat transfer coefficient to pressure drop ratio, pump work, performance index, irreversibility and exergetic efficiency are investigated. Variation of Nusselt number with Reynolds number has also been studied for different nanoparticle volume ratios. Improvement up to 15.2% has been observed in the heat transfer coefficient for MWCNT (0:5) nanofluid with the negligible enhancement of 0.02% in the pump work and 2.96% enhancement in the performance index. Hydrothermal performance of nanofluids increases with increase in MWCNT ratio in particle mixture due to the negligible effect on pressure drop. No optimum ratio has been found within the studied mixture ratios of nanoparticles."
207,Explicit forms of the trace formula for GL(2),A. Aydoğdu;Y. Flicker;E. Özkan;R. Öztürk,Journal d'Analyse Mathematique,"There has recently been renewed interest in the trace formula–in particular, that of the initial case of GL(2)–due to counting applications in the function field case. For these applications, one needs a very precise form of the trace formula, with all terms computed explicitly. Our aim in this work is to compute the trace formula for GL(2) over a number field in as full detail as was done for the function field case and to give an accessible exposition, being motivated by these applications to counting, but also by pure curiosity as to the optimal form of this plastic formula. We also explain a correction argument in our context here of GL(2). The idea is to introduce a global summand which does not change the formula globally but changes the local weighted orbital integrals at the hyperbolic terms, so that their limit at the identity becomes a unipotent contribution to the trace formula. This gives a harmonious and pleasing form to the formula. Finally, we put the trace formula in an invariant form; thus all its terms are distributions whose value at a test function f y (x) = f(y −1 xy) is independent of y in GL(2,A)."

Alexiev,ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters,"The mechanisms of drug–receptor interactions and the controlled delivery of drugs via biodegradable and biocompatible nanoparticulate carriers are active research fields in nanomedicine. Many clinically used drugs target G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to the fact that signaling via GPCRs is crucial in physiological and pathological processes and thus central for the function of biological systems. In this letter, a fast and reliable ratiometric fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (rmFLIM) approach is described to analyze the distribution of protein–ligand complexes in the cellular context. Binding of the fluorescently labeled antagonist naloxone to the G-protein coupled μ-opioid receptor is used as an example. To show the broad applicability of the rmFLIM method, we extended this approach to investigate the distribution of polymer-based nanocarriers in histological liver sections."
209,Exploring individual and contextual factors contributing to tobacco cessation intervention implementation,A. Andrés;Y. Castellano;M. Fu;A. Feliu;C. Martínez,Addictive Behaviors,"Previous research suggests that smoking cessation interventions are poorly implemented. This study reports the development and testing of a questionnaire including knowledge, attitude, behavioral, and organizational (KABO) factors affecting the implementation of smoking cessation practices in hospitals by health care providers and organizations.An initial pool of 44 items was developed to assess the individual knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of health professionals towards smoking cessation practices according to the 5 A's intervention model, as well as organizational barriers and opportunities for its implementation. Items were measured in a scale from 0=“Not at all/Never” to 10 = “Completely/Always”. Data were collected from health workers (n = 702) in Catalonia. The validity of the instrument was measured by: (a) analyzing the items, (b) assessing the internal structure, (c) estimating the internal consistency, and (d) analyzing the relationship between this tool and the 5 A's intervention model.Seven domains were extracted: individual skills, positive organizational support, attitudes and beliefs, individual commitment, organizational resources, beliefs about patient desire/readiness to quit, and organizational endorsement. These domains explained 69.7% of the variance, and allowed for the development of a refined 26-item version of the questionnaire. Both the seven domains and the total scale showed adequate internal consistency.Psychometric testing indicates that the KABO questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing the main barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation intervention implementation. Individual factors better explained the implementation of smoking cessation interventions in hospitals, and the seven identified domains can be used for further investigations into how the implementation of evidence-based practices impacts smoking cessation performance."
210,Extended Scale-Free Networks,A. Charpentier;E. Flachaire,ArXiv Statistics,"Recently, Alderson et al. (2009) mentioned that (strict) Scale-Free networks were rare, in real life. This might be related to the statement of Stumpf, Wiuf & May (2005), that sub-networks of scale-free networks are not scale-free. In the later, those sub-networks are asymptotically scale-free, but one should not forget about second-order deviation (possibly also third order actually). In this article, we introduce a concept of extended scale-free network, inspired by the extended Pareto distribution, that actually is maybe more realistic to describe real network than the strict scale free property. This property is consistent with Stumpf, Wiuf & May (2005): sub-network of scale-free larger networks are not strictly scale-free, but extended scale-free."
211,External Electric Field Effects on Fluorescence of Pyrene Butyric Acid in a Polymer Film: Concentration Dependence and Temperature Dependence,A. Ara;T. Iimori;T. Yoshizawa;T. Nakabayashi;N. Ohta,Journal of Physical Chemistry B,"Fluorescence spectra and electrofluorescence spectra (plots of the electric field-induced change in fluorescence intensity as a function of wavelength) have been measured at different temperatures for pyrene butyric acid (PBA) in a PMMA film at different concentrations. At a low concentration of 0.5 mol % where fluorescence emitted from the locally excited state of PBA (LE fluorescence) is dominant, LE fluorescence spectra show only the Stark shift in the presence of an electric field (F), which results from the difference in molecular polarizability between the ground and emitting states. At a high concentration of 10 mol % where the so-called sandwich-type excimer fluorescence (EX(1)) is dominant, both EX(1) and LE fluorescence are quenched by F. Another fluorescence assigned to a partially overlapped excimer (EX(2)) also exists at room temperature, and this emission is enhanced by F. As the temperature decreases, three fluorescence emissions whose electric field effects are different from each other become clear besides EX(1) and LE fluorescence, indicating that at least five fluorescence components exist at high concentrations at low temperatures. At a medium concentration of 5 mol % where EX(1) is comparable in intensity to the LE fluorescence, the intensity of EX(1) is not affected by F at any temperature, but LE fluorescence and EX(2) are markedly influenced by F at room temperature, and four fluorescence emissions are confirmed at low temperatures."

Diggelen,Biological Conservation,"Although plant-soil interactions are increasingly recognized as an important factor in ecosystem restoration, their effects on community assembly during de novo ecosystem establishment are largely unknown. In a heathland restoration trial after topsoil removal we introduced either only aboveground heathland species with fresh herbage or both above- and belowground heathland species with sods to facilitate community assembly. Sod inoculation increased resemblance of the microbial community to the reference system, with a higher fungal and lower bacterial proportion to the community structure. Also densities of bacteriophagous and phytophagous nematodes, Acari and Collembola increased after sod inoculation. The cover of heathland plant species increased by 49% after sod inoculation. The introduction of solely aboveground heathland species increased the cover of these species by only 13%, and did not affect soil community assembly. Additionally, the increase in cover of heathland species over time was inversely correlated to the cover of mesotrophic grassland species. Inverse correlations were also observed between changes in fungal and bacterial abundances.

214,Factors that influence array layout on wave energy farms,A. Andrés;R. Guanche;L. Meneses;C. Vidal;I. Losada,Ocean Engineering,"This paper presents a study of the factors that influence array layout on wave energy farms. The WEC considered is a two-body heave converter extracted from Babarit et al. (2012). Simulations were run through a time domain model from de Andres et al. (2013) with irregular waves considering different sea states. Factors analyzed in this paper are array layout, WEC separation, number of WECs and wave directionality. Results show that wave directionality is very important in order to achieve constructive interference. When looking at the number of WECs the conclusion is that as the larger the number of WECs, more interactions are possible and therefore, the higher the interaction factor is. Regarding array layout, triangle and square configurations were found to be similar and the efficiency of each one depends on the most probable peak period. Separating distance was found to be a key factor and L10/2 was set as the optimal one. Finally, wave climate was classified in different subtypes around the globe. The optimum layout in these sites was assessed. The influence of directionality was studied and the triangular configuration was found to be the most favorable for multidirectional climates while square configurations were most adequate in unidirectional climates.A wave farm composed by several two body heaving WECs is investigated.The computation is done through a time domain model from de Andres et al.

Chaudhary,Journal of Environmental Management,"A moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) coupled with solar parabolic structured system has been designed and developed to get the maximum organic load removal and microbial disinfection from the wastewater. The effluent was first subjected to organic degradation in MBBR (with optimized carrier filling rate of 30%) followed by the bacterial degradation using solar energy in parabolic trough and the changes in values of parameters like pH, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD) and microbial count were monitored. The titanium dioxide (TiO2) was used as a photocatalyst for the removal of organic load from the wastewater but in optimized conditions. At optimum dose of 1.0 g/L of TiO2 and pH value of 7.6, maximum COD removal of 69% and 13% was achieved at sunny days (solar irradiation 400–700 W m−2) and cloudy days (solar irradiation 170–250 W m−2) respectively within 5–6 h solar irradiation time. The results obtained showed that it is possible to decrease in six logarithms (log) the concentration of TC and FC within only 240 min of solar exposure. Moreover, this process can offer economically reasonable, chemical free and practical solution to the processing of municipal wastewater where solar intensity is readily available and can be used for making zero liquid discharge (ZLD) an effective reality."
218,Feeding ecology and ingestion of plastic fragments by Priacanthus arenatus: What's the fisheries contribution to the problem?,A. Cardozo;E. Farias;J. Rodrigues-Filho;I. Moteiro;D. Dantas,Marine Pollution Bulletin,"Atlantic Bigeye (Priacanthus arenatus) is a demersal species from the Priacanthidae family with little literature relating to its biology and catch aspects. Due to this lack of research, the focus of this effort was to describe the feeding preferences of Atlantic Bigeye and to evaluate the influence of plastic debris derived from the local fisheries activities on its diet. The most important items were Corophiidae, Penaeidae, Actinopterygii, Isopoda, Cephalopoda, Policheta and plastic. Plastic was present in 49.17% of the stomachs analyzed. A total of 210 plastic fragments were found, and 63% were derived from fishing. Of those, 55% were derived from paint fragments from vessels and 8% from synthetic fibers (PA). The results suggest that plastic fragments found in stomachs are related to the species' natural diet and that this debris is locally deposited in the coastal environment. Fishing resources appear to have been affected by this local marine pollution."
219,Field Trial of LTE eMBMS Network for TV Distribution: Experimental Results and Analysis,A. Awada;E. Lang;O. Renner;K. Friederichs;S. Petersen;K. Pfaffinger;B. Lembke;R. Brugger,IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting,"In recent years, the advances in mobile network technologies have revolutionized the paradigm how the users receive video and audio content. With the rise of smart phones and tablets having large screens, users have become more interested than anytime before in watching linear and non-linear TV programs on their mobile devices. This is because the users can fetch nowadays the content using their mobile devices at anytime and any place they are located. Facing this phenomenon, broadcasters are looking for new means to reach the users of digital natives that are interested in watching TV on their mobile devices. As most mobile devices are based on a global 3rd generation partnership project standard, the enhanced multimedia broadcast multicast system (eMBMS) of long term evolution (LTE) network is foreseen as one potential candidate for delivering broadcast services. In order to investigate the capability and limitations of today's LTE eMBMS network, a field trial was carried out in Munich, Germany. This paper describes the setup of the field trial and presents a comprehensive analysis of the LTE eMBMS technology with respect to performance and future enhancements. The measurement data is compared against simulation models for field strength and path loss of each transmitter, eMBMS useful field strength and received power, and signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR). Moreover, the performance of cyclic prefix (CP) durations that are longer than the standardized values of 16.67 us and 33.33 us is evaluated using the calibrated simulation models. Results have shown that the simulation models can adequately predict the measurement data. Moreover, it is shown that a CP duration of 66.67 us provides a gain in SINR and achieves the best tradeoff in terms of maximum user velocity and performance in networks with limited inter-site distance."
220,Film formation of coatings studied by diffusing-wave spectroscopy,A. Brun;H. Dihang;L. Brunel,Progress in Organic Coatings,"The coating industry is facing nowadays a growth in environmental regulations, and imposed substitution of suspected toxic components or solvents and a constant need for improving performances. The new formulations undergo new film-formation processes, influencing the coating performance and appearance.We have studied the film-formation process of several coating systems (water-based and solvent-based) using a new optical technology based on diffusing-wave spectroscopy. This unique and simple technique allows a non-intrusive monitoring of the drying process on the appropriate substrate (concrete, metal, plastic, wood, etc.). The kinetics of film formation, displayed in real-time, provide a new vision of the successive steps of the mechanisms taking place (evaporation, packing, etc.) as well as accurate information on drying times such as open-time, for an in-depth characterization of the film-formation process.The coating industry is facing nowadays a growth in environmental regulations, and imposed substitution of suspected toxic components or solvents and a constant need for improving performances.

222,Fluid Collections in and Around the Pancreas in Acute Pancreatitis,A. Brun;N. Agarwal;C. Pitchumoni,Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology,"The advent of computed tomographic scan with its wide use in the evaluation of acute pancreatitis has opened up a new topic in pancreatology i.e. fluid collections. Fluid collections in and around the pancreas occur often in acute pancreatitis and were defined by the Atlanta Symposium on Acute Pancreatitis in 1992. Two decades since the Atlanta Conference additional experience has brought to light the inadequacy and poor understanding of the terms used by different specialists involved in the care of patients with acute pancreatitis when interpreting imaging modalities and the need for a uniformly used classification system. The deficiencies of the Atlanta definitions and advances in medicine have led to a proposed revision of the Atlanta classification promulgated by the Acute Pancreatitis Classification Working Group. The newly used terms “ acute peripancreatic fluid collections ,” “ pancreatic pseudocyst ,” “postnecrotic pancreatic/peripancreatic fluid collections,” and “ walled-off pancreatic necrosis ” are to be clearly understood in the interpretation of imaging studies. The current treatment methods for fluid collections are diverse and depend on accurate interpretations of radiologic tests. Management options include conservative treatment, percutaneous catheter drainage, open and laparoscopic surgery, and endoscopic drainage. The choice of treatment depends on a correct diagnosis of the type of fluid collection. In this study we have attempted to clarify the management and clinical features of different types of fluid collections as they have been initially defined under the 1992 Atlanta Classification and revised by the Working Group's proposed categorization."
223,Fluid flow and seismicity pattern: Evidence from the 1997 Umbria‐Marche (central Italy) seismic sequence,A. Antonioli;D. Piccinini;L. Chiaraluce;M. Cocco,Geophysical Research Letters,[1] We model the spatial and temporal evolution of seismicity during the 1997 Umbria‐Marche seismic sequence in terms of subsequent failures promoted by fluid flow. The diffusion process of pore‐pressure relaxation is represented as a pressure perturbation generated by coseismic stress changes and propagating through a fluid saturated medium. The values of isotropic diffusivity range between 22 and 90 m2/s. The calculated value of anisotropic diffusivity (Daniso = 250 m2/s) is largest along the average strike (N140°) direction of activated faults. Our results suggest that the observed spatio‐temporal migration of seismicity is consistent with fluid flow.
224,Food by-products as potential antioxidant and antimicrobial additives in chill stored raw lamb patties,A. Andrés;M. Petrón;J. Adámez;M. López;M. Timón,Meat Science,"The aim of this work was to study the in vitro antioxidant potential of aqueous extracts obtained from tomato (TOM), red grape (GRA), olive (OLI) and pomegranate (POM) by-products as well as to evaluate the effect of their addition into lamb meat patties (1000 mg/kg) in order to improve shelf life. A negative (CON) and a positive control (sodium ascorbate, ASC) were also included in the experiment. Results for radical scavenging activity, metal chelating activity and reducing power indicated that GRA and OLI extracts could inhibit oxidation more efficiently than POM and TOM extracts (P &lt; 0.01). Consistently, GRA and OLI treatments showed the highest redness (a*) (P &lt; 0.01) and antioxidant activity, both for lipids and proteins, throughout storage (P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, in general, microbial counts were reduced by the addition of by-products extracts. These results suggest that the extracts obtained from grape and olive pomaces could be effectively used to replace sodium ascorbate in lamb meat products.Aqueous extracts were obtained from pomegranate, red grape, tomato and olive pomaces and were added into lamb meat patties.Grape and olive extracts slowed down discoloration of patties during storage, at the same level as sodium ascorbate, a currently used additive.Grape and olive extracts showed an antioxidant effect, higher than ascorbate.The addition of pomegranate, red grape, tomato and olive pomaces decreased microbial counts in lamb patties.The aim of this work was to study the in vitro antioxidant potential of aqueous extracts obtained from tomato (TOM), red grape (GRA), olive (OLI) and pomegranate (POM) by-products as well as to evaluate the effect of their addition into lamb meat patties (1000 mg/kg) in order to improve shelf life.

225,Functional analysis of the grapevine paralogs of the SMG7 NMD factor using a heterolog VIGS-based gene depletion-complementation system,A. Benkovics;T. Nyikó;Z. Mérai;D. Silhavy;G. Bisztray,Plant Molecular Biology,"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic quality control system that identifies and eliminates transcripts having a premature translation termination codon (PTC). NMD is also involved in the control of several wild-type mRNAs. The NMD core machinery consists of three highly conserved NMD factors (UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3) and at least one less conserved 14-3-3-like domain containing protein (SMG7). A PTC is identified by UPF factors, and then SMG7 triggers rapid transcript decay. UPF factors are generally encoded by a single gene, whereas SMG7 has duplicated several times during evolution. Recently it was reported that the plant SMG7 is autoregulated through NMD and that SMG7 has two relatively divergent paralogs in dicots, SMG7 and SMG7L. In mammals all three SMG7 related genes (SMG5, SMG6 and SMG7) are essential in NMD, so we hypothesized that in plants the SMG7 and SMG7L duplicates may also play distinct roles in NMD. To test this possibility, we have analyzed the evolution and the function of plant SMG7 homologs. We show that SMG7L is not required for plant NMD. Interestingly, we found that the grapevine and poplar genomes contain two quite divergent SMG7 paralogs which may have derived from an ancient duplication event. Using heterolog depletion/complementation assays we demonstrate that both grapevine SMG7 copies retained the complete NMD activity and both of them are under NMD control, whilst SMG7L has lost NMD activity and NMD control."
226,Gender quotas and the quality of politicians,A. Baltrunaite;P. Bello;A. Casarico;P. Profeta,Journal of Public Economics,"We analyze the effects of the introduction of gender quotas in candidate lists on the quality of elected politicians, as measured by the average number of years of education. We consider an Italian law which introduced gender quotas in local elections in 1993, and was abolished in 1995. As not all municipalities went through elections during this period, we identify two groups of municipalities and use a Difference in differences estimation. We find that gender quotas are associated with an increase in the quality of elected politicians, with the effect ranging from 0.12 to 0.24 years of education. This effect is due not only to the higher number of elected women, who are on average more educated than men, but also to the lower number of low-educated elected men. The positive effect on quality is confirmed when we measure the latter with alternative indicators, it persists in the long run and it is robust to controlling for political ideology and political competition."
227,Genetic ancestry as an effect modifier of naltrexone in smoking cessation among African Americans: an analysis of a randomized controlled trial,A. Bress;R. Kittles;C. Wing;S. Hooker;A. King,Pharmacogenetics and Genomics,"Objectives: To determine whether there were differential quit rates between African Americans (AA) and European Americans with the experimental treatment naltrexone , and examine the role of genetic ancestry on these outcomes among AAs. Methods: Data from a previous randomized trial of 315 smokers to naltrexone versus placebo were reanalyzed using West African (WA) genetic ancestry to define subpopulations. Logistic regression models were used to estimate treatment effects on early and end of treatment quit rates, by race and WA ancestry . Results: Among European Americans ( n =136), naltrexone significantly increased quit rates at 4 weeks (62 vs. 43%, P =0.03) with directional, but not statistically significant effects at 12 weeks (30 vs. 18%, P =0.12). In contrast, among the AAs ( n =95), quit rates did not differ between naltrexone and placebo groups at either interval (4 weeks: 43 vs. 32%, P =0.27; 12 weeks: 22 vs. 18%, P =0.60). A median split was conducted in AAs for WA ancestry . Among AAs with low WA ancestry , quit rates were significantly higher with naltrexone compared with placebo (60 vs. 27%, P =0.03). There was no advantage in quit rates with naltrexone for the high WA ancestry group. Conclusion: Naltrexone efficacy for smoking cessation varies across AA individuals with different levels of WA ancestry . These results suggest that genetic background may partially explain racial differences in drug response."
228,Genetic and environmental correlations between various anthropometric and blood pressure traits among adult Samoans,A. Choh;T. Gage;S. Mcgarvey;A. Comuzzie,American Journal of Physical Anthropology,"Shared polygenic effects (i.e., pleiotropy) are assumed to exist for such obesity‐related phenotypes as blood pressure and adiposity. It is possible to identify these shared genetic effects through bivariate genetic analyses. This analysis of 1,342 adult Samoans, across 801 pedigrees, indicates that significant heritable components (P &lt; 0.05) ranging from 29–58% exist for weight, height, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, triceps skinfold, subscapular skinfold, body mass index, and sum of skinfolds. In general, the anthropometric measurements share additive genetic effects, as do the anthropometric measures, with blood pressure. Heritabilities for central fat distribution are not significant in this population, which could be due to a lack of power. On the other hand, heritabilities have been found in Hispanics; hence the genes responsible for central fat distribution may not be evenly distributed among populations.

230,Global non-quadratic D -stabilization of Takagi–Sugeno systems with piecewise continuous membership functions,A. Cherifi;K. Guelton;L. Arcese;V. Leite,Applied Mathematics and Computation,"This paper deals with the non-quadratic stabilization of Takagi–Sugeno (T-S) models with D-stability constraints. Based on a recently proposed Non-Quadratic Lyapunov Function (NQLF), which involves the mean values of the membership functions (MFs) over a given time interval, three theorems are proposed for the design of non-Parallel Distributed Compensation (non-PDC) controllers satisfying closed-loop D-stability specifications. Despite previous non-quadratic approaches and thanks to the nature of the considered NQLF, it is highlighted that the proposed LMI-based procedures not only apply for the global non-quadratic D-stabilization of T-S models, but also for a larger class of T-S models with piecewise membership functions (i.e. a class of switching nonlinear systems), since no requirement is needed regarding to the bounds of the MFs derivatives. The effectiveness of the proposed LMI-based conditions and their relative degrees of conservatism, compared with previous quadratic D-stabilization results, are illustrated through an academic example involving piecewise membership functions."
231,Gradient retention prediction of acid–base analytes in reversed phase liquid chromatography: A simplified approach for acetonitrile–water mobile phases,A. Andrés;M. Rosés;E. Bosch,Journal of Chromatography A,"In previous work, a two-parameter model to predict chromatographic retention of ionizable analytes in gradient mode was proposed. However, the procedure required some previous experimental work to get a suitable description of the pKa change with the mobile phase composition. In the present study this previous experimental work has been simplified. The analyte pKa values have been calculated through equations whose coefficients vary depending on their functional group. Forced by this new approach, other simplifications regarding the retention of the totally neutral and totally ionized species also had to be performed. After the simplifications were applied, new prediction values were obtained and compared with the previously acquired experimental data. The simplified model gave pretty good predictions while saving a significant amount of time and resources.A new model to predict the retention of acidic and basic analytes involving two adjustable parameters is proposed.The proposed model includes equations to calculate the evolution of the analyte pKa with the mobile phase composition.The proposed model is successfully validated for different buffered mobile phases and gradient patterns.The accuracy of the obtained predictions is good enough taking into account that very little experimental effort is required.In previous work, a two-parameter model to predict chromatographic retention of ionizable analytes in gradient mode was proposed.

232,Gram-positive cocci in Dutch ICUs with and without selective decontamination of the oropharyngeal and digestive tract: a retrospective database analysis,A. Bij;D. Frentz;M. Bonten;J. Stuart;B. Hees,Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy,"The objective of this study was to determine time trends in the rate of Gram-positive cocci in 42 Dutch ICUs that continuously used or did not use selective oropharyngeal decontamination (SOD) or selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) and ICUs that introduced SOD/SDD.The Dutch Surveillance System on Antibiotic Resistance was used to determine monthly rates of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates, including resistant phenotypes, in blood and respiratory tract specimens from 2008 to 2013. Per patient, the last isolate per species per month was selected, and cumulative rates per 100 beds per month were determined. Time trends were analysed by multilevel Poisson regression.Eighteen ICUs used SOD/SDD (1296 months), 13 did not use SOD/SDD (936 months) and 11 introduced SOD/SDD (373 months before and 419 months after introduction). There was no significant increase in the rate of Gram-positive cocci in ICUs that used SOD/SDD. Introduction of SOD/SDD was associated with increased rates of S. aureus (β = 0.018, 95% CI 0.006–0.030) and E. faecalis isolates (β = 0.028, 95% CI 0.006–0.051) in respiratory tract specimens. Numbers of resistant phenotypes remained low, and an observed increase in E. faecium isolates (β = 0.033, 95% CI 0.012–0.054), 97% of which were resistant to ampicillin, in the absence of SOD/SDD disappeared after the introduction of SOD/SDD.In ICUs with a low endemicity of resistance, introduction of SOD/SDD was associated with increased rates of S. aureus and E. faecalis isolates, but not with resistant phenotypes. Continuous 5 year use of SOD/SDD was not associated with increased isolation of Gram-positive cocci."
233,Ground vibrations due to seismic detonation in oil exploration,A. Awojobi;O. Sobayo,Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics,"Previous works on this subject deal mainly with establishing an empirical relationship between the extent of the vibration at the building site (measured by the peak particle velocity), the distance of the building from the explosive, the energy content of the explosive and the frequency of detonating the explosives. These works are mainly limited to cases where the explosives are placed on the surface. However, the practical case requires that the explosive is considered to be buried, either on the sea‐bed in offshore operations or underground in land explorations. This practical case has hitherto received little attention."
234,Ground vibrations due to seismic detonation of a buried source,A. Awojobi;O. Sobayo,Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics,"The problem of vibrations at the free surface of an elastic half‐space due to detonation of a buried source is studied here from the viewpoint of the geophysical seismic technique employed in oil exploration. The fundamental assumption of the theory, therefore, is that the pressure at the source is impulsive and a Dirac delta function of time. The depth of the source below the surface of the medium is considered in the present theory as an additional parameter which has hitherto made the buried source problem formidable and, therefore, has limited almost all previous works to the relatively easy problem of surface blasting."
235,Growth-Melt Asymmetry in Crystals and Twelve-Sided Snowflakes,A. Cahoon;M. Maruyama;J. Wettlaufer,Physical Review Letters,"It is in the lexicon of crystal growth that the shape of a growing crystal reflects the underlying microscopic architecture. Although it is known that in weakly nonequilibrium conditions the slowest growing orientations ultimately dominate the asymptotic shape, is the same true for melting? Here we observe and show theoretically that while the two-dimensional steady melt shapes of ice are bounded by six planes, these planes are not proper facets but instead are rotated 30 degrees from the prism planes of ice. Finally, the transient melting state exposes 12 apparent crystallographic planes thereby differing substantially from the transient growth state."
236,"Gun control and suicide: The impact of state firearm regulations in the United States, 1995–2004",A. Andrés;K. Hempstead,Health Policy,"To empirically assess the impact of firearm regulation on male suicides.A negative binomial regression model was applied by using a panel of state level data for the years 1995–2004. The model was used to identify the association between several firearm regulations and male suicide rates.Our empirical analysis suggest that firearms regulations which function to reduce overall gun availability have a significant deterrent effect on male suicide, while regulations that seek to prohibit high risk individuals from owning firearms have a lesser effect.Restricting access to lethal means has been identified as an effective approach to suicide prevention, and firearms regulations are one way to reduce gun availability. The analysis suggests that gun control measures such as permit and licensing requirements have a negative effect on suicide rates among males. Since there is considerable heterogeneity among states with regard to gun control, these results suggest that there are opportunities for many states to reduce suicide by expanding their firearms regulations."
237,Has renewable energy induced competitive behavior in the Spanish electricity market?,A. Ciarreta;M. Espinosa;C. Pizarro-Irizar,Energy Policy,"Recent energy policy has favored a massive introduction of Renewable Energy Sources on electricity markets, which has greatly impacted their performance. First, the electricity price has decreased as a consequence of the so-called merit-order effect. Another relevant effect is associated to the intermittent nature of Renewable Energy, which has increased the cost of ancillary services. A third and important aspect, less addressed in the literature, is the induced change in the strategic behavior of the conventional electricity producers. In principle, the entry of new generators in a concentrated market would make it more competitive and change the strategic behavior of the incumbents. We test this hypothesis for the Spanish wholesale market. While we find no significant change in behavior for Nuclear, Hydropower and Coal, a change is observed in Combined Cycle bidding strategies after the entry of renewable generators. Our analysis shows that the massive entry of Renewable Energy Sources made other generators' behavior more competitive in the short run, but the effect was not persistent.The indirect effects of RES affect prices in electricity markets.RES induced little change in Nuclear, Coal and Hydropower generation.Combined Cycle bidding strategies have evolved to adapt to the introduction of RES.RES made Combined Cycle's behavior more competitive in the short run.The competitive effect induced by RES is not persistent in the long run.Recent energy policy has favored a massive introduction of Renewable Energy Sources on electricity markets, which has greatly impacted their performance.

238,High contrast sensitivity for visually guided flight control in bumblebees,A. Chakravarthi;A. Kelber;E. Baird;M. Dacke,Journal of Comparative Physiology A,"Many insects rely on vision to find food, to return to their nest and to carefully control their flight between these two locations. The amount of information available to support these tasks is, in part, dictated by the spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity of their visual systems. Here, we investigate the absolute limits of these visual properties for visually guided position and speed control in Bombus terrestris. Our results indicate that the limit of spatial vision in the translational motion detection system of B. terrestris lies at 0.21 cycles deg−1 with a peak contrast sensitivity of at least 33. In the perspective of earlier findings, these results indicate that bumblebees have higher contrast sensitivity in the motion detection system underlying position control than in their object discrimination system. This suggests that bumblebees, and most likely also other insects, have different visual thresholds depending on the behavioral context."
239,High paracellular nutrient absorption in intact bats is associated with high paracellular permeability in perfused intestinal segmentsHigh paracellular nutrient absorption in intact bats is associated with high paracellular permeability in perfused intestinal segmentsHigh paracellular nutrient absorption in intact bats is associated with high paracellular permeability in perfused intestinal segments,A. Brun;E. Price;M. Gontero-Fourcade;G. Fernandez-Marinone;A. Cruz-Neto;W. Karasov;E. Caviedes-Vidal,Journal of Experimental Biology,"Water-soluble nutrients are absorbed by the small intestine via transcellular and paracellular mechanisms. Based on a few previous studies, the capacity for paracellular nutrient absorption seems greater in flying mammals than in nonflying mammals, but there has been little investigation of the mechanisms driving this difference. Therefore, we studied three species each of bats (Artibeus lituratus, Sturnira lilium and Carollia perspicillata) and nonflying mammals (Akodon montensis, Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus). Using standard pharmacokinetic techniques in intact animals, we confirmed the greater paracellular nutrient absorption in the fliers, comparing one species in each group. Then we conducted in situ intestinal perfusions on individuals of all species. In both approaches, we measured the absorption of 3OMD-glucose, a nonmetabolizable glucose analog absorbed both paracellularly and transcellularly, as well as l-arabinose, which has no mediated transport. Fractional absorption of l-arabinose was three times higher in the bat (S. lilium: 1.2±0.24) than in the rodent (A. montensis: 0.35±0.04), whereas fractional absorption of 3OMD-glucose was complete in both species (1.46±0.4 and 0.97±0.12, respectively). In agreement, bats exhibited two to 12 times higher l-arabinose clearance per square centimeter nominal surface area than rodents in intestinal perfusions. Using l-arabinose, we estimated that the contribution of the paracellular pathway to total glucose absorption was higher in all three bats (109–137%) than in the rodents (13–39%). These findings contribute to an emerging picture that reliance on the paracellular pathway for nutrient absorption is much greater in bats relative to nonflying mammals and that this difference is driven by differences in intestinal permeability to nutrient-sized molecules."
240,High performance concrete under elevated temperatures,A. Akca;N. Zihnioğlu,Construction and Building Materials,"In this study, PP fibers and air entraining admixture (AEA) were used together in an high performance concrete (HPC) mix so as to create interconnected reservoirs in concrete and to improve fire performance of HPC. For this reason, nine mixes of HPC incorporating blast furnace slag with 0.24 water-to-binder ratio and various PP and AEA contents were produced. Specimens were cast in two different sizes in order to see the effect of size and 18 series of specimens were obtained. These series subjected to elevated temperatures (300 °C, 600 °C and 900 °C) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and after air cooling, residual mass and compressive strength of specimens were determined. The heated specimens were observed both at macro and micro scales to investigate the color changes, cracking and spalling of HPC at various temperatures. Also, thermogravimetric analyses were performed on powder samples from each nine mixes. Results showed that addition of AEA diminished the decrease in residual strength but this result was found to be irregular after 300 °C for thick specimens. The collaboration of AEA and PP fibers decreased the risk of spalling of HPC. Also, size of specimen was found to be important in deterioration of HPC.Performance of HPCs under elevated temperatures.Use of PP fibers with air entraining admixture to decrease damage.Decreased spalling and increased residual strength.Complete disintegration of dense matrix under very high temperatures.Microstructural examination of cement paste–aggregate interface.In this study, PP fibers and air entraining admixture (AEA) were used together in an high performance concrete (HPC) mix so as to create interconnected reservoirs in concrete and to improve fire performance of HPC. For this reason, nine mixes of HPC incorporating blast furnace slag with 0.24 water-to-binder ratio and various PP and AEA contents were produced. Specimens were cast in two different sizes in order to see the effect of size and 18 series of specimens were obtained. These series subjected to elevated temperatures (300 °C, 600 °C and 900 °C) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and after air cooling, residual mass and compressive strength of specimens were determined. The heated specimens were observed both at macro and micro scales to investigate the color changes, cracking and spalling of HPC at various temperatures. Also, thermogravimetric analyses were performed on powder samples from each nine mixes.

Albuquerque,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology","Aquatic environments in the high-Andean may be quite vulnerable to climatic conditions and hydrological processes (precipitation/evaporation) that have the potential to alter water levels and chemistry. This study reconstructs the paleohydrological history of Lake Tota, Colombia, to provide a record of environmental changes in the eastern flank of the Colombian Andes during the late Holocene. A 54 cm core was collected at the margin of the lake at a depth of 1.5 m, and the paleohydrological reconstructions were based on changes in diatom assemblages, granulometry, and bulk organic geochemical parameters. The core was subdivided into 5 biozones by assessing the significance of the variance among the CONISS clusters. Biozone T5 (base, 4000 calibrated years BP) was dominated by the planktonic diatom Discostella stelligera and was deposited in a period of high-water level. Sedimentation during this period was rich in carbon due to phytoplanktonic production; the granulometry data suggests that the lake was under high to moderate hydrological dynamic conditions, indicating active deposition at the river delta front. Biozone T4, beginning at 3600 cal. yrs BP, was dominated by three species D. stelligera, Cocconeis placentula var. lineata and Fragilaria sensu lato, and this association could indicate that the lake was under the influence of large fluctuations in water level. This interpretation is supported by granulometry and geochemical data, particularly by the low levels of total organic carbon (TOC). In biozone T3, corresponding to 3000 cal. yrs BP, we found a lowering of the water level, suggested by low levels of TOC. Poor granulometric sorting and higher carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratios suggest a macrophyte influence on the sedimentation, avoiding direct deltaic influence. In this biozone the benthic diatom F. sensu lato group was dominant. In biozone T2, starting 2400 cal. yrs BP, the proxies indicate that the lake experienced increasing water levels and that stronger circulation patterns occurred in the water column than in the preceding periods, as inferred by the presence of Aulacoseira granulata a ticoplanktonic species. The sediment in this biozone is well sorted and finer, indicating a greater depth. Biozone T1 at the top of the core and since 2000 cal. yrs BP to the present, evidence for a recent reduction in water level of Lake Tota can be deduced by the presence of Achnanthidium minutissimum var. minutissimum.Multi-proxy study of an important tropical lake in ColombiaDuring the middle–late Holocene, changes in the proxies were observed.A wet phase is evidenced until 3050 cal. yrs BP could correspond to the ITCZ shift.A dry phase between 3050 and 2450 cal. yrs BP could be related to the El Niño events.Aquatic environments in the high-Andean may be quite vulnerable to climatic conditions and hydrological processes (precipitation/evaporation) that have the potential to alter water levels and chemistry.

243,How To Control the Crystalline Structure of Supracrystals of 5-nm Silver Nanocrystals,A. Courty;J. Richardi;P. Albouy;M. Pileni,Chemistry of Materials,"Supracrystals of 5-nm silver nanocrystals are characterized by various structures, ranging from face-centered-cubic (fcc), to hexagonal-close-packed (hcp), to body-centered-cubic (bcc) structures. Here, it is shown that the transition from fcc to hcp is solvent-dependent and attributed to specific stacking processes, depending on the evaporation kinetics. Hence, at a fixed substrate temperature, the most volatile solvents (such as hexane and toluene) favor the growth of fcc superlattices, whereas with solvents that have a higher boiling point (such as octane, decane, and dodecane), hcp supracrystals are produced. In contrast, the formation of bcc structures is shown to be solvent-independent and is attributed to van der Waals attractions. The chain length of the coating agent and the deposition temperature govern the transition from compact (fcc/hcp) to bcc supracrystals. The experimentally phase transitions are interpreted by theoretical approaches."
244,Hubert's multi‐rater kappa revisited,A. Andrés;M. Hernández,British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology,"There is a frequent need to measure the degree of agreement among R observers who independently classify n subjects within K nominal or ordinal categories. The most popular methods are usually kappa‐type measurements. When R = 2, Cohen's kappa coefficient (weighted or not) is well known. When defined in the ordinal case while assuming quadratic weights, Cohen's kappa has the advantage of coinciding with the intraclass and concordance correlation coefficients. When R &gt; 2, there are more discrepancies because the definition of the kappa coefficient depends on how the phrase ‘an agreement has occurred’ is interpreted. In this paper, Hubert's interpretation, that ‘an agreement occurs if and only if all raters agree on the categorization of an object’, is used, which leads to Hubert's (nominal) and Schuster and Smith's (ordinal) kappa coefficients. Formulae for the large‐sample variances for the estimators of all these coefficients are given, allowing the latter to illustrate the different ways of carrying out inference and, with the use of simulation, to select the optimal procedure. In addition, it is shown that Schuster and Smith's kappa coefficient coincides with the intraclass and concordance correlation coefficients if the first coefficient is also defined assuming quadratic weights."
245,"Human glioblastoma ADF cells express tyrosinase, L‐tyrosine hydroxylase and melanosomes and are sensitive to L‐tyrosine and phenylthiourea",A. Bonfigli;O. Zarivi;S. Colafarina;A. Cimini;A. Ragnelli;P. Aimola;P. Natali;M. Cerù;F. Amicarelli;M. Miranda,Journal of Cellular Physiology,"Melanocytes and neuroblasts share the property of transforming L‐tyrosine through two distinct metabolic pathways leading to melanogenesis and catecholamine synthesis, respectively. While tyrosinase (TYR) activity has been shown to be expressed by neuroblastoma it remains to be established as to whether also glioblastomas cells are endowed with this property. We have addressed this issue using the human continuous glioblastoma cell line ADF. We demonstrated that these cells possess tyrosinase as well as L‐tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity and synthesize melanosomes. Because the two pathways are potentially cyto‐genotoxic due to production of quinones, semiquinones, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), we have also investigated the expression of the peroxisomal proliferators activated receptor α (PPARα) and nuclear factor‐kB (NFkB) transcription factor as well the effect of L‐tyrosine concentration on cell survival. We report that L‐tyrosine down‐regulates PPARα expression in ADF cells but not neuroblastoma and that this aminoacid and phenylthiourea (PTU) induces apoptosis in glioblastoma and neuroblastoma. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc."
246,Hybrid 1-D dielectric microcavity: Fabrication and spectroscopic assessment of glass-based sub-wavelength structures,A. Chiasera;J. Jasieniak;S. Normani;S. Valligatla;M. Ferrari,Ceramics International,"Two different 1-D multilayer dielectric microcavities are presented, one activated by Er3+ ions fabricated by rf-sputtering and other one containing CdSe@Cd0.5Zn0.5S quantum dots obtained by a hybrid radio frequency-sputtering/solution deposition process. The rare-earth activated cavity is constituted by an Er3+ -doped SiO2 active layer inserted between two Bragg reflectors consisting of 10 pairs of SiO2/TiO2 layers. Starting from the deposition procedure used for this cavity a fabrication protocol was defined with the aim to combine the high reproducibility allowed by the sputtering deposition for the fabrication of multilayers structures with the ability of fabricate films activated with highly luminescent quantum dots dispersed in polymeric matrix. In this case the cavity was constituted by poly-laurylmethacrylate host matrix containing CdSe@Cd0.5Zn0.5S quantum dots inserted between two Bragg reflectors consisting of 10 pairs of SiO2/TiO2 layers fabricated by rf-sputtering on SiO2 substrate. The thicknesses of the films of the Bragg reflectors were tailored in order to reflect the visible radiation at around 650 nm. Transmittance spectra were employed to assess the optical features of the single Bragg gratings and whole samples. Luminescence measurements put in evidence that emissions strongly influenced by the presence of the cavities for both the samples."
247,Hydrogenolysis of glycerol over a highly active CuO/ZnO catalyst prepared by an oxalate gel method: influence of solvent and reaction temperature on catalyst deactivation,A. Bienholz;F. Schwab;P. Claus,Green Chemistry,"The hydrogenolysis of glycerol was performed in an autoclave at temperatures between 190 and 225 °C and at a H2 pressure of 5 MPa over a CuO/ZnO catalyst prepared by an oxalate gel (OG) method. Compared to a CuO/ZnO catalyst prepared by coprecipitation, much higher conversions of glycerol and space–time yields up to 9.8 gpropylene glycol gCu−1 h−1 are achieved with CuO/ZnO-OG, whereas both catalysts produced propylene glycol with selectivities of about 90%. Additionally, the influence of the temperature and the solvent was examined. Compared to a conversion of glycerol of only 5% in an aqueous glycerol solution, the use of 1,2-butanediol as a solvent leads to a high conversion of 55%. Moreover, experiments were carried out in pure glycerol and from transmission electron microscopy images of fresh and spent catalysts, it was obvious that the morphology of the catalyst changed during the reaction. By X-ray diffraction and N2O chemisorption, it was proved that a tremendous loss of copper surface area occurred during the hydrogenolysis of glycerol. Taking together the influence of the solvent on the conversion of glycerol and the results of the catalyst characterization, it can be concluded that water, as an unavoidable by-product of the reaction, is responsible for a strong deactivation of the catalyst."

249,Identification and Characterization of Frontal Lobe Degeneration: Historical Perspective on the Development of FTD,A. Brun,Alzheimer Disease and Associated Disorders,"This is a historical account of the development of the concept frontotemporal dementia, beginning with our discovery in the late 60s of a simple degenerative form. It was named frontal lobe degeneration of non-Alzheimer type to clearly separate it from the then almost totally dominating diagnosis Alzheimer disease. In the absence of immunohistochemical methods for specific disease markers, we had to rely solely on structural features. Later, from the 80s, the successively introduced methods to show glial acidic protein, tau, synaptophysin, ubiquitin, and other markers confirmed our impression of a simple type of degeneration. These methods also added further forms with additional features, and from the 90s genetics has contributed new disease characteristics, all these advances leading up to the present conceptual structure of frontotemporal lobar degeneration ."

251,"Impact of carrier filling ratio on oxygen uptake & transfer rate, volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient and energy saving potential in a lab-scale MBBR",A. Barwal;R. Chaudhary,Journal of Water Process Engineering,"This study investigates the effect of bio-carriers on the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) in the effluent of the reactor with an aim to provide optimized filling ratio for the practical operation of a moving bed biofilm reactor. The experimental work was carried out in seven different phases with respect to the filling ratio. In each phase, oxygen transfer efficiency and volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient (kla) were measured by varying the carrier filling ratio (10–70%). The effect of filling ratios, mixing intensity, hydraulic retention time and kla on OUR were observed. The value of OUR increased 2–3 times with the augmentation of carrier filling ratio but it decreased when more carriers were added inside the reactor. Secondly, efforts were also made to find ways to reduce aeration energy. Savings of energy consumption (up to 35%) were noted by providing intermittent aeration at an average oxygen transfer rate of 6 mg-O2L−1 h−1. Still, further scope exists to conserve more energy if the oxygen transfer rate is maintained at 4 mg-O2L−1 h−1."
252,Impact of intercurrent illness on calcium homeostasis in children with hypoparathyroidism: a case series,A. Chinoy;M. Skae;A. Babiker;D. Kendall;M. Mughal;R. Padidela,Endocrine Connections,"Hypoparathyroidism is characterised by hypocalcaemia, and standard management is with an active vitamin D analogue and adequate oral calcium intake (dietary and/or supplements). Little is described in the literature about the impact of intercurrent illnesses on calcium homeostasis in children with hypoparathyroidism.We describe three children with hypoparathyroidism in whom intercurrent illnesses led to hypocalcaemia and escalation of treatment with alfacalcidol (1-hydroxycholecalciferol) and calcium supplements.Three infants managed with standard treatment for hypoparathyroidism (two with homozygous mutations in GCMB2 gene and one with Sanjad-Sakati syndrome) developed symptomatic hypocalcaemia (two infants developed seizures) following respiratory or gastrointestinal illnesses. Substantial increases in alfacalcidol doses (up to three times their pre-illness doses) and calcium supplementation were required to achieve acceptable serum calcium concentrations. However, following resolution of illness, these children developed an increase in serum calcium and hypercalciuria, necessitating rapid reduction to pre-illness dosages of alfacalcidol and oral calcium supplementation.Intercurrent illness may precipitate symptomatic hypocalcaemia in children with hypoparathyroidism, necessitating increase in dosages of alfacalcidol and calcium supplements. Close monitoring is required on resolution of the intercurrent illness, with timely reduction of dosages of active analogues of vitamin D and calcium supplements to prevent hypercalcaemia, hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis."
253,Impact of legislative reform on benefit access and disability duration in workers' compensation: an interrupted time series study,A. Collie;D. Beck;S. Gray;T. Lane,Occupational and Environmental Medicine,"Objectives To determine the impact of legislative changes to the New South Wales (NSW) workers’ compensation scheme on injured workers access to benefits, insurer claim processing and work disability duration.Methods Population-based interrupted time series study of workers’ compensation claims made in NSW 2 years before and after legislative amendment in June 2012. Outcomes included incidence of accepted claims per 100 000 workers, the median and 75th percentile insurer decision time in days, and the median and 75th percentile of work disability duration in weeks. Effects were assessed relative to a comparator of seven other Australian workers’ compensation jurisdictions.Results n=1 069 231 accepted workers’ compensation claims were analysed. Claiming in NSW fell 15.3% following legislative reform, equivalent to 46.6 fewer claims per 100 000 covered workers per month. This effect was greater in time loss claims (17.3%) than medical-only claims (10.3%). Across models, there were consistent trend increases in insurer decision time. Median work disability duration increased following the legislative reform.Conclusions The observed reduction in access to benefits was consistent with the policy objective of improving the financial sustainability of the compensation scheme. However, this was accompanied by changes in other markers of performance that were unintended, and are suggestive of adverse health consequences of the reform. This study demonstrates the need for care in reform of workers’ compensation scheme policy."
254,Impact of twisted alignment on the smectic layer structure of ferroelectric liquid crystal,A. Bawa;T. Lamba;A. Choudhary;G. Singh;A. Biradar,Journal of Molecular Liquids,"The twisted aligned cell of ferroelectric liquid crystal is assessed through electro-optical and dielectric spectroscopy and a comparison is made with antiparallel planar aligned cells of the same thickness around 8 μm. The study has been carried in two types of twisted aligned samples, one is natural cooled sample in the heating chamber and another is slow cooled at the rate of 0.05 °C/min. The influential distinct results have been observed in natural cooled twisted cells. In natural cooled cells, the helicoidal structure at the surface and in the bulk of the cell is distinct and contributes separately to the dielectric presponse of the cell. On the other hand, at the same cooling condition in twisted cell, the smectic layers are in a twisted state resulting into a non-uniform helical structure, therefore, the partial helicoidal unwound structure at the surface and in the bulk of the cell are not observed contributing to the dielectric permittivity separately unlike in planar aligned cell. The twisted cell is found to induce the restoring force within the sample. However, the slow cooling cycles on the twisted cell changes to the strain free to an equilibrium state, whereas the behavior of the planar sample cell remains unchanged. The studies are significant for the display devices based on twisted alignment of FLC cells."

Embid,Optics and Laser Technology,"Gamma radiation detection in the range of 662 keV, the reference for environmental protection, is done through extrinsic optical fiber sensors. The fluorescence rendered by an inorganic scintillator when irradiated with such gamma rays is gathered by a modified polymer optical fiber tip. This modification increases the recorded signal when compared with plain unaltered fiber. Two fiber tip modification are then compared in terms of light gathering capability. A chemically etched fiber, in which the cladding and part of the core are removed, and a tapered fiber in which the core-cladding structure is kept. Both structures are comparable in length and final diameter, and show linear response in the tested range up to 2 Gy/h air Kerma rate. The etched fiber shows a higher slope than the tapered one, although both improve the signal gathered by a plain fiber tip. The easy fabrication and handling of the reported transducers, together with the improved signal gathering, allow to reduce the overall system budget with the use of low-cost optoelectronics in the detection stage. This offers a significant improvement for surveillance systems in radioprotection applications, in which presence of gamma radiation coming out accidental leakage or spurious sources activity is the main target.Extrinsic sensors applied to lower energy ranges than previously reported ones.Improvement of fluorescence signal gathering over plain unaltered fiber tip.Easy fabrication and handling.

256,In Praise of Convergent Thinking,A. Cropley,Creativity Research Journal,": Free production of variability through unfettered divergent thinking holds out the seductive promise of effortless creativity but runs the risk of generating only quasicreativity or pseudocreativity if it is not adapted to reality. Therefore, creative thinking seems to involve 2 components: generation of novelty (via divergent thinking) and evaluation of the novelty (via convergent thinking). In the area of convergent thinking, knowledge is of particular importance: It is a source of ideas, suggests pathways to solutions, and provides criteria of effectiveness and novelty. The way in which the 2 kinds of thinking work together can be understood in terms of thinking styles or of phases in the generation of creative products. In practical situations, divergent thinking without convergent thinking can cause a variety of problems including reckless change. Nonetheless, care must be exercised by those who sing the praises of convergent thinking: Both too little and too much is bad for creativity."

Huwe;M. Walker,Toxicological Sciences,"The mouse heart is a target of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) during fetal development, and microarray analysis demonstrates significant changes in expression of cardiac genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. We tested the hypothesis that developmental TCDD exposure would disrupt cardiac ECM expression and be associated with changes in cardiac morphology in adulthood. In one study, time-pregnant C57BL/6 mice were dosed with corn oil or 1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 μg TCDD/kg on gestation day (GD) 14.5 and sacrificed on GD 17.5, when changes in fetal cardiac mRNA expression were analyzed using quantitative PCR. TCDD induced mRNA expression of genes associated with ECM remodeling (matrix metalloproteinase 9 and 13, preproendothelin-1 [preproET-1]), cardiac hypertrophy (atrial natriuretic peptide, β-myosin heavy chain, osteopontin), and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation (cytochrome P4501A1, AHR repressor). Further, all TCDD-induced changes required the AHR since gene expression was not altered in AHR knockout fetuses. In a second study, time-pregnant mice were treated with corn oil or 6.0 μg TCDD/kg on GD 14.5, and male offspring were assessed for changes in cardiac gene expression and cardiac and renal morphology at 3 months. All TCDD-induced changes in cardiac gene expression observed fetally, except for preproET-1, remained induced in the hearts of adult male offspring. Adult male offspring of TCDD-exposed dams also displayed cardiac hypertrophy, decreased plasma volume, and mild hydronephrosis. These results demonstrate that in utero and lactational TCDD exposures alter cardiac gene expression and cardiac and renal morphology in adulthood, which may increase the susceptibility to cardiovascular dysfunction."

259,In vivo phenotypic and molecular characterization of retinal degeneration in mouse models of three ciliopathies,A. Brun;X. Yu;C. Obringer;D. Ajoy;V. Marion,Experimental Eye Research,"Cilia are highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed organelles. Ciliary defects of genetic origins lead to ciliopathies, in which retinal degeneration (RD) is one cardinal clinical feature. In order to efficiently find and design new therapeutic strategies the underlying mechanism of retinal degeneration of three murine model was compared. The rodent models correspond to three emblematic ciliopathies, namely: Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS), Alström Syndrome (ALMS) and CEP290-mediated Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA). Scotopic rodent electroretinography (ERG) was used to test the retinal function of mice, Transmitted Electron microscopy (T.E.M) was performed to assess retinal structural defects and real-time PCR for targeted genes was used to monitor the expression levels of the major apoptotic Caspase-related pathways in retinal extracts to identify pathological pathways driving the RD in order to identify potential therapeutic targets. We found that BBS and CEP290-mediated LCA mouse models exhibit perinatal retinal degeneration associated with rhodopsin mislocalization in the photoreceptor and the induction of an Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress. On the other hand, the tested ALMS mouse model, displayed a slower degeneration phenotype, with no Rhodopsin mislocalization nor ER-stress activity. Our data points out that behind the general phenotype of vision loss associated with these ciliopathies, the mechanisms and kinetics of disease progression are different."

261,Including root reinforcement variability in a probabilistic 3D stability model,A. Cislaghi;E. Chiaradia;G. Bischetti,Earth Surface Processes and Landforms,"Forests play a significant role in protecting people, settlements in mountainous terrains from hydrogeomorphic hazards, including shallow landslides. Although several studies have investigated the interactions between forests and slope instabilities, a full understanding of them has not yet been obtained. Additionally, models that incorporate forest stand properties into slope failure probability analyses have not been developed. In principle, physical‐based models, which are powerful tools for landslide hazard analyses, represent an appropriate approach to linking stand properties and slope stability. However, the reliability of these models depends on numerous parameters that describe highly complex geotechnical and hydrological processes (e.g. potential failure depth, saturation ratio, root reinforcement, etc.) that are difficult to measure and model. In particular, the spatial heterogeneity of root reinforcement remains a problem, and the use of physically based models from a forest management perspective has been limited."
262,Income inequality games,A. Charpentier;S. Mussard,Journal of Economic Inequality,"The paper explores different applications of the Shapley value for either inequality or poverty measures. We first investigate the problem of source decomposition of inequality measures, the so-called additive income sources inequality games, based on the Shapley value, introduced by Chantreuil and Trannoy (1999) and Shorrocks (1999). We show that multiplicative inequality games provide dual results compared with Chantreuil and Trannoy’s ones. We also investigate the case of multiplicative poverty games for which indices are non additively decomposable in order to capture contributions of sub-indices, which are multiplicatively connected with, as in the Sen-Shorrocks-Thon poverty index. We finally show, in the case of additive poverty indices, that the Shapley value may be equivalent to traditional methods of decomposition such as subgroup consistency and additive decomposition."
263,Incorporating fabrication cost into topology optimization of discrete structures and lattices,A. Asadpoure;J. Guest;L. Valdevit,Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization,"In this article, we propose a method to incorporate fabrication cost in the topology optimization of light and stiff truss structures and periodic lattices. The fabrication cost of a design is estimated by assigning a unit cost to each truss element, meant to approximate the cost of element placement and associated connections. A regularized Heaviside step function is utilized to estimate the number of elements existing in the design domain. This makes the cost function smooth and differentiable, thus enabling the application of gradient-based optimization schemes. We demonstrate the proposed method with classic examples in structural engineering and in the design of a material lattice, illustrating the effect of the fabrication unit cost on the optimal topologies. We also show that the proposed method can be efficiently used to impose an upper bound on the allowed number of elements in the optimal design of a truss system. Importantly, compared to traditional approaches in structural topology optimization, the proposed algorithm reduces the computational time and reduces the dependency on the threshold used for element removal."
264,"Increase of sexually transmitted infections, but not HIV, among young homosexual men in Amsterdam: are STIs still reliable markers for HIV transmission?",A. Bij;I. Stolte;R. Coutinho;N. Dukers,Sexually Transmitted Infections,"Objectives: The incidence of HIV and STIs increased among men who have sex with men (MSM) visiting our STI clinic in Amsterdam. Interestingly, HIV increased mainly among older (⩾35 years) MSM, whereas infection rates of rectal gonorrhoea increased mainly in younger men. To explore this discrepancy we compared trends in STIs and HIV in a cohort of young HIV negative homosexual men from 1984 until 2002.Methods: The study population included 863 men enrolled at ⩽30 years of age from 1984 onward in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS). They had attended at least one of the 6 monthly follow up ACS visits at which they completed a questionnaire (including self reported gonorrhoea and syphilis episodes) and were tested for syphilis and HIV. Yearly trends in HIV and STI incidence and risk factors were analysed using Poisson regression.Results: Mean age at enrolment was 25 years. The median follow up time was 4 years. Until 1995 trends in HIV and STI incidence were concurrent, however since 1995 there was a significant (p<0.05) increase in syphilis (0 to 1.4/100 person years (PY)) and gonorrhoea incidence (1.1 to 6.0/100 PY), but no change in HIV incidence (1.1 and 1.3/100 PY).Conclusions: The incidence of syphilis and gonorrhoea has increased among young homosexual men since 1995, while HIV incidence has remained stable. Increasing STI incidence underscores the potential for HIV spread among young homosexual men. However, several years of increasing STIs without HIV, makes the relation between STI incidence and HIV transmission a subject for debate."
265,Industrial energy usage in Australia and the potential for implementation of solar thermal heat and power,A. Beath,Energy,"A review of industrial energy usage for Australia was undertaken to identify potential sites for utilisation of solar thermal energy. The review identified 2498 individual sites by location, industry type, energy use and characteristic process temperature. This data is presented on maps in terms of both industry type, and characteristic process temperature, in discrete ranges for comparison with the approximate insolation patterns and to identify sites that should be considered for more detailed analysis. High insolation areas of Australia are not heavily populated or industrialised, but there are electricity demands for many remote communities and mining sites that may be suitable targets for solar thermal power generation projects. Relatively few industrial sites were present in areas of high insolation that could utilise higher temperature heat directly, but some potential opportunities were identified involving bauxite and laterite ore processing, ammonia production, oil refining and natural gas processing. In areas with moderate insolation, outside major cities, there are numerous sites in the food processing, building products, textiles and wood products industries that could utilise low to moderate temperature solar heat."
266,Inferences about a linear combination of proportions,A. Andrés;M. Hernández;I. Tejedor,Statistical Methods in Medical Research,"Statistical methods for carrying out asymptotic inferences (tests or confidence intervals) relative to one or two independent binomial proportions are very frequent. However, inferences about a linear combination of K independent proportions L = Σβipi (in which the first two are special cases) have had very little attention paid to them (focused exclusively on the classic Wald method). In this article the authors approach the problem from the more efficient viewpoint of the score method, which can be solved using a free programme, which is available from the webpage quoted in the article. In addition the article offers approximate formulas that are easy to calculate, gives a general proof of Agresti’s heuristic method (consisting of adding a certain number of successes and failures to the original results before applying Wald’s method) and, finally, it proves that the score method (which verifies the desirable properties of spatial and parametric convexity) is the best option in comparison with other methods."
267,Influence of the electrical sliding speed on friction and wear processes in an electrical contact copper–stainless steel,A. Bouchoucha;S. Chekroud;D. Paulmier,Applied Surface Science,"Among the various parameters that influence the friction and wear behaviour of a copper–stainless steel couple crossed by an electrical current and in a dry contact is the sliding speed. The tests were carried out under ambient environment and the sliding speed was in the range of 0.2–8 ms−1. The electrical current intensity was varied from 0 to 40 A and held constant during each experiment. The normal load was maintained constant corresponding to an average Hertzian stress of 107 Pa. It appears that the friction coefficient and the wear rate increase at first with the speed, reach their maximums, then slowly decrease and tend to constant values. Over the entire range of sliding speeds two types of wear are observed. These latters are essentially mild wear as long as hard debris do not appear at the interface and severe wear when debris consisting of oxides or oxide metal mixture become big enough, they are removed from the surface and have abrasive effect. The results are discussed in terms of observations of wear debris size and composition, wear track study, metallographic study of worn surfaces and friction and electrical contact resistance records.Among the various parameters that influence the friction and wear behaviour of a copper–stainless steel couple crossed by an electrical current and in a dry contact is the sliding speed.

268,Influence of the microstructure on the magnetoresistance of manganite thin films,A. Andrés;M. Garcı́A-Hernández;A. Muñoz-Martı́N;L. Martı́N;J. Martı́Nez,Thin Solid Films,"We present magnetic and electric transport studies on several series of La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 polycrystalline pellets and thin films. The thin films were obtained by DC magnetron sputtering on several substrates and by sol–gel deposition technique on Si (100). The diffraction patterns show the polycrystalline character of films grown on Si by both techniques. The morphology was studied by AFM and the mean grain sizes were obtained. The steady decrease of the low-temperature magnetoresistance (MR) at high fields is explained by the increase of the effective section for conduction by the orientation of pinned Mn magnetic moments at the surface of the grains and, therefore, depend strongly on the connectivity between grains. On the contrary, the low-field MR is related to the magnetic behavior of the ferromagnetic domains of the grains. Low- and high-field MR characteristics of thin films deposited on different substrates are correlated to their microstructure."

270,"Injured worker experiences of insurance claim processes and return to work: a national, cross-sectional study",A. Collie;L. Sheehan;T. Lane;S. Gray;G. Grant,BMC Public Health,"Background Insurance claims management practices may have a significant impact on the health and experiences of injured workers claiming in workers’ compensation systems. There are few multi-jurisdictional studies of the way workers experience compensation processes, and limited data on the association between claims experience and return to work outcomes. This study sought to identify worker, claim and injury related factors associated with injured worker experiences of workers’ compensation claims management processes, and to examine associations between claims experience and return to work. Methods A national, cross-sectional survey of injured workers involved in ten Australian workers’ compensation schemes. A total of 10,946 workers completed a telephone survey at 6 to 24 months post claim acceptance. Predictors of positive or negative/neutral claims experience were examined using logistic regression. Associations between claims experience, return to work status and duration of time loss were examined using logistic regression. Results Nearly one-quarter (23.0%, n = 2515) of workers reported a negative or neutral claims experience. Injury type, jurisdiction of claim, and time to lodge claim were most strongly associated with claims experience. Having a positive claims experience was strongly associated with having returned to work after accounting for injury, worker, claim and employer factors. Conclusions There is a strong positive association between worker experiences of the insurance claims process and self-reported return to work status. Revision and reform of workers’ compensation claims management practices to enhance worker experience and the fairness of procedures may contribute to improved return to work outcomes."
271,Insights from life history theory for an explicit treatment of trade‐offs in conservation biology,A. Charpentier,Conservation Biology,"en As economic and social contexts become more embedded within biodiversity conservation, it becomes obvious that resources are a limiting factor in conservation. This recognition is leading conservation scientists and practitioners to increasingly frame conservation decisions as trade‐offs between conflicting societal objectives. However, this framing is all too often done in an intuitive way, rather than by addressing trade‐offs explicitly. In contrast, the concept of trade‐off is a keystone in evolutionary biology, where it has been investigated extensively. I argue that insights from evolutionary theory can provide methodological and theoretical support to evaluating and quantifying trade‐offs in biodiversity conservation. I reviewed the diverse ways in which trade‐offs have emerged within the context of conservation and how advances from evolutionary theory can help avoid the main pitfalls of an implicit approach. When studying both evolutionary trade‐offs (e.g., reproduction vs. survival) and conservation trade‐offs (e.g., biodiversity conservation vs. agriculture), it is crucial to correctly identify the limiting resource, hold constant the amount of this resource when comparing different scenarios, and choose appropriate metrics to quantify the extent to which the objectives have been achieved. Insights from studies in evolutionary theory also reveal how an inadequate selection of conservation solutions may result from considering suboptimal rather than optional solutions when examining whether a trade‐off exits between 2 objectives. Furthermore, the shape of a trade‐off curve (i.e., whether the relationship between 2 objectives follows a concave, convex, or linear form) is known to affect crucially the definition of optimal solutions in evolutionary biology and very likely affects decisions in biodiversity conservation planning too. This interface between evolutionary biology and biodiversity conservation can therefore provide methodological guidance to support decision makers in the difficult task of choosing among conservation solutions. Percepciones de la Teoría de Historia de Vida para una Tratamiento Explícito de las Compensaciones en la Biología de la Conservación Abstractes Resumen A la vez que los contextos económicos y sociales se involucran más en la conservación de la biodiversidad, se vuelve obvio que los recursos son un factor limitante en la conservación. Este reconocimiento está llevando a los científicos de la conservación y a quienes la practican a enmarcar frecuentemente a las decisiones de conservación como compensaciones entre objetivos sociales en conflicto. Sin embargo, esto suele hacerse de manera intuitiva, en lugar de dirigirse explícitamente a las compensaciones. En contraste, el concepto de compensación es una piedra angular en la biología evolutiva, en donde se ha investigado extensivamente. En este artículo discuto que las percepciones de la teoría evolutiva pueden proporcionar apoyo teorético y metodológico a la evaluación y cuantificación de las compensaciones en la conservación de la biodiversidad. Revisé las diversas formas en las que las compensaciones han emergido dentro del contexto de la conservación y cómo los avances de la teoría evolutiva pueden ayudar a evitar las principales dificultades de un enfoque implícito. Al estudiar las compensaciones evolutivas (p. ej.: reproducción vs. supervivencia) y las compensaciones de conservación (p. ej.: conservación de la biodiversidad vs. agricultura), es importante identificar correctamente al recurso limitante, mantener como constante el aumento de este recurso al compararlo con escenarios diferentes y elegir las medidas apropiadas para cuantificar el alcance al que se han logrado los objetivos. Las percepciones de estudios de la teoría evolutiva también revelan cómo una selección no adecuada de soluciones de conservación puede resultar de considerar soluciones sub‐óptimas en lugar de soluciones opcionales al examinar si las compensaciones salen de entre dos objetivos. Además, se sabe que la forma de la curva de compensación (es decir, si la relación entre dos objetivos sigue una forma cóncava, convexa o lineal) afecta crucialmente la definición de las soluciones óptimas en la biología evolutiva y muy probablemente también afecte a las decisiones en la planeación de la biología de la conservación. Esta interconexión entre la biología evolutiva y la conservación de la biodiversidad puede proporcionarnos así una guía metodológica que apoye a quienes toman las decisiones en la difícil labor de elegir entre las soluciones de conservación."

Nielsen,Pediatric Research,Bronchial wall remodeling is a major morbidity component in oxidant injury in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and asthma. Hypothesis: IGF-1 enhances alpha smooth muscle expression and collagen synthesis in developing lung fibroblasts leading to fibrosis through nuclear NF-kB -dependent transcription. We studied NF-kB dependent transcription by transfecting HFLF with a NF-kB responsive promoter driving the luciferase gene and treating with IGF-1 (100 ng/mL) and measuring luciferase activity. We exposed cells to the PI-3 kinase inhibitor or the Erk1/2 inhibitor one hr before stimulating with IGF-1. We also used IGF-1 receptor antibody to inhibit the action of IGF-1 and studied its effect on alpha-sma and type I collagen. IGF-1 treatment significantly increased luciferase activity. This was attenuated by PI-3 kinase and MAP-Kinase inhibitors. Western blot analysis showed PI-3 kinase mediates IGF-1 activation of NF-kB independent of IKB phosphorylation. We found an up-regulation of phospho NF-kB in the nuclear extract compared with total NFKB showing that IGF-1 regulates NF-kB transcriptional activity downstream of NF-kB nuclear translocation. IGF-1-induced increase in alpha-sma expression and type-I collagen was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with LY294002 and IGF-1 receptor antibody. IGF-1 cell signaling leading to collagen synthesis in fetal lung fibroblasts is mediated by PI3 Kinase acting through NF-kB in HFLF.Bronchial wall remodeling is a major morbidity component in oxidant injury in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and asthma.

273,Integrable Floquet Hamiltonian for a Periodically Tilted 1D Gas,A. Colcelli;G. Mussardo;G. Sierra;A. Trombettoni,ArXiv Physics,An integrable model subjected to a periodic driving gives rise generally to a non-integrable Floquet Hamiltonian. Here we show that the Floquet Hamiltonian of the integrable Lieb--Liniger model in presence of a linear potential with a periodic time--dependent strength is instead integrable and its quasi-energies can be determined using the Bethe ansatz approach. We discuss various aspects of the dynamics of the system at stroboscopic times and we also propose a possible experimental realisation of the periodically driven tilting in terms of a shaken rotated ring potential.
274,Integrating the human sciences to evolve effective policies,A. Biglan;C. Cody,Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization,"This paper describes an evolutionary perspective on human development and wellbeing and contrasts it with the model of self-interest that is prominent in economics. The two approaches have considerably different implications for how human wellbeing might be improved. Research in psychology, prevention science, and neuroscience is converging on an evolutionary account of the importance of two contrasting suites of social behavior—prosociality vs. antisocial behaviors (crime, drug abuse, risky sexual behavior) and related problems such as depression. Prosociality of individuals and groups evolves in environments that minimize toxic biological and social conditions, promote and richly reinforce prosocial behavior and attitudes, limit opportunities for antisocial behavior, and nurture the pursuit of prosocial values. Conversely, antisocial behavior and related problems emerge in environments that are high in threat and conflict. Over the past 30 years, randomized trials have shown numerous family, school, and community interventions to prevent most problem behaviors and promote prosociality. Research has also shown that poverty and economic inequality are major risk factors for the development of problem behaviors. The paper describes policies that can reduce poverty and benefit youth development. Although it is clear that the canonical economic model of rational self-interest has made a significant contribution to the science of economics, the evidence reviewed here shows that it must be reconciled with an evolutionary perspective on human development and wellbeing if society is going to evolve public policies that advance the health and wellbeing of the entire population."
275,Interaction between phospholipids and new Gemini catanionic surfactants having anti-HIV activity,A. Brun;G. Brezesinski;H. Möhwald;M. Blanzat;I. Rico-Lattes,Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects,"Monolayers at the air/water interface are used as 2D models of biological membrane to study the interaction of a new Gemini catanionic surfactant, Gem16,12, with the phospholipid DPPC. Gem16,12 is a synthetic analog of galactosylceramide (a cell receptor for HIV-1) and shows both good anti-HIV activity and low toxicity. Adsorption kinetics measurements are performed at Gemini concentrations below the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) and show a decrease of surface tension with increasing concentration. If the surface is covered with a DPPC monolayer at molecular areas with still zero surface pressure the adsorption of Gem16,12 is faster and leads to a higher surface pressure compared with the pure air/water interface. Film balance, fluorescence microscopy and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) experiments were performed after reaching the equilibrium surface tension. The experiments show an incorporation of Gem16,12 molecules into the fluid phase as well as into the condensed domains of a DPPC monolayer. GIXD experiments confirmed these results showing a smaller tilt angle in a DPPC monolayer on a Gemini subphase compared to DPPC on pure water. Compressing such a mixed monolayer leads first to the squeezing out of Gem16,12 molecules from the fluid part of the monolayer and above 30 mN/m to the squeezing out from the condensed part.Monolayers at the air/water interface are used as 2D models of biological membrane to study the interaction of a new Gemini catanionic surfactant, Gem16,12, with the phospholipid DPPC.

This study has two objectives: a) to analyse the interactions between testosterone levels and CAG repeat length polymorphism as a modulator of androgen receptor (AR) sensitivity with regard to impulsiveness traits, and b) to evaluate the contribution of other biological variables as Luteinising Hormone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (LF, FSH, SHBG) and albumin in the relationship between testosterone levels and AR CAG length polymorphism with impulsiveness. A sample of 105 healthy males (mean age 26.71 ± 9.68 SEM) was analysed resulting in three groups of subjects according to CAG repeat lengths. Impulsiveness was measured through the Barratt's Impulsiveness Personality Scale, including three components: Motor Impulsiveness, Cognitive Impulsiveness and Non-Planning Impulsiveness. A series of ANOVAS and linear regression models predicting impulsiveness scales were conducted. Age, hormones, CAG repeat length and hormone × CAG repeat interactions were included in the regression models as independent variables. Results show that subjects with short or medium CAG repeat length tended to show higher impulsiveness phenotypes compared to long CAG repeat. The interaction between Free Testosterone and CAG, and between SHBG and CAG accounted for differences on impulsiveness (R: .47, R2: .22 and R: .43; R2: .18, respectively).This pattern was especially observed for the short CAG repeat group and Motor Impulsiveness.Impulsive personality phenotype has been extensively related with genetic and hormonal factors.

277,Internal Migrations in France in the Nineteenth Century,A. Charpentier;E. Gallic,ArXiv Physics,"The digital age allows data collection to be done on a large scale and at low cost. This is the case of genealogy trees, which flourish on numerous digital platforms thanks to the collaboration of a mass of individuals wishing to trace their origins and share them with other users. The family trees constituted in this way contain information on the links between individuals and their ancestors, which can be used in historical demography, and more particularly to study migration phenomena. This article proposes to use the family trees of 238, 009 users of the Geneanet website, or 2.5 million (unique) individuals, to study internal migration. The case of 19th century France is taken as an example. Using the geographical coordinates of the birthplaces of individuals born in France between 1800 and 1804 and those of their descendants, we study migration between generations at several geographical scales. We start with a broad scale, that of the departments, to reach a much finer one, that of the cities. Our results are consistent with those of the literature traditionally based on parish or civil status registers. The results show that the use of collaborative genealogy data not only makes it possible to recover known facts in the literature, but also to enrich them."
278,Internal consistency reliability and construct validity of the Attitude toward Muslim Proximity Index (AMPI): a measure of social distance,A. Brockett;A. Village;L. Francis,British Journal of Religious Education,"The Attitude toward Muslim Proximity Index (AMPI) is a six‐item scale that uses tolerance to different degrees of social distance to assess prejudice towards Muslims. It was tested on 1777 teenage school children from northern England who indicated their religion as either ‘Christian’ or ‘no religion’, and demonstrated good internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .81). The index was higher among pupils who supported the views of the British National Party and among those who believed that British Muslims should adopt Western culture; but lower among those who knew Muslims or had Muslim friends. The AMPI is a useful measure of Islamophobic attitudes that does not rely on responses to specific events or on detailed knowledge of the Muslim religion."
279,Internal marketing of attitudes in Caribbean tourism,A. Crick,International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management,Tourism is the mainstay of the Caribbean and the attitude of the people in the region may have a significant impact on the success of the industry. This paper analyzes the way in which tourism authorities of three Caribbean destinations have internally marketed tourism to their host populations in order to encourage the desired attitudinal expressions. A matrix of five possible responses to tourism was developed and each of the three countries was found to occupy different positions in the matrix. An analysis of the internal marketing strategies determined that the countries adopted different approaches based on their particular challenges but none of the approaches had achieved lasting success. The study concludes with recommendations for future research.
280,"Interplay Between Triplet-, Singlet-Charge Transfer States and Free Charge Carriers Defining Bimolecular Recombination Rate Constant of Organic Solar Cells",A. Armin;J. Durrant;S. Shoaee,Journal of Physical Chemistry C,"Despite the myriad of organic donor:acceptor materials, only few systems have emerged in the life of organic solar cells to exhibit considerable reduced bimolecular recombination, with respect to the random encounter rate given by the Langevin equation. Monte Carlo simulations have revealed that the rate constant of the formation of electron–hole bound states depends on the random encounter of opposite charges and is nearly given by the Langevin equation for the domain sizes relevant to efficient bulk heterojunction systems. Recently, three studies suggested that charge transfer states dissociating much faster than their decay rate to the ground state, can result in reduced bimolecular recombination by lowering the recombination rate to the ground state as a loss pathway. A separate study identified another loss pathway and suggested that forbidden back electron transfer from triplet charge transfer states to triplet excitons is a key to achieving reduced recombination. Herein we further explain the reduced bimolecular recombination by investigating the limitations of these two proposals. By solving kinetic rate equations for a BHJ system with realistic rates, we show that both of these previously presented conditions must only be held at the same time for a system to exhibit non-Langevin behavior. We demonstrate that suppression of both of the parallel loss channels of singlet and triplet states can be achieved through increasing the dissociation rate of the charge transfer states; a crucial requirement to achieve a high charge carrier extraction efficiency."
281,Intrinsic Vibrational Coherence in Face-Centered Cubic Supra-Crystals of Silver Nanocrystals: Raman Scattering Measurements,A. Courty;P. Albouy;A. Mermet;E. Duval;M. Pileni,Journal of Physical Chemistry B,"The ordering of silver nanocrystals is tuned from amorphous aggregates to highly well-ordered, face-centered cubic supra-crystals, using various substrates and controlling their temperature to obtain this. Low-frequency Raman scattering, for the first time, demonstrates vibrational coherence in fcc supra-crystals of nanocrystals. This is shown by a narrowing of the peak corresponding to the quadrupolar modes of the nanocrystals. However, this is obtained when the supra-crystals are smaller than the excitation wavelength. When the supra-crystals are larger, the narrowing cannot be observed. Furthermore, for any size of the supra-crystals, a shift to low frequency of the Raman peak due to the Lorentz field effect is seen."
282,Investigating Glutamatergic Mechanism in Attention and Impulse Control Using Rats in a Modified 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task,A. Benn;E. Robinson,PLOS ONE (Social Sciences),"The 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT) has been widely used to study attention and impulse control in rodents. In order to mimic cognitive impairments in psychiatry, one approach has been to use acute administration of NMDA antagonists. This disruption in glutamatergic transmission leads to impairments in accuracy, omissions, and premature responses although findings have been inconsistent. In this study, we further investigated glutamatergic mechanisms using a novel version of the 5CSRTT, which we have previously shown to be more sensitive to cognitive enhancers. We first investigated the effects of systemic treatment with NMDA antagonists. We also carried out a preliminary investigation using targeted medial prefrontal cortex infusions of a NMDA antagonist (MK801), mGluR2/3 antagonist (LY341495), and mGluR7 negative allosteric modulator (MMPIP). Acute systemic administration of the different NMDA antagonists had no specific effects on accuracy. At higher doses PCP, ketamine, and memantine, increased omissions and affected other measures suggesting a general disruption in task performance. Only MK801 increased premature responses, and reduced omissions at lower doses suggesting stimulant like effects. None of the NMDA antagonists affected accuracy or any other measures when tested using a short stimulus challenge. Infusions of MK801 had no effect on accuracy but increased premature responses following infralimbic, but not prelimbic infusion. LY341495 had no effects in either brain region but a decrease in accuracy was observed following prelimbic infusion of MMPIP. Contrary to our hypothesis, disruptions to glutamate transmission using NMDA antagonists did not induce any clear deficits in accuracy in this modified version of the 5CSRTT. We also found that the profile of effects for MK801 differed from those observed with PCP, ketamine, and memantine. The effects of MK801 in the infralimbic cortex add to the literature indicating this brain region and glutamate play an important role in impulse control."
283,Investigation of array robustness to sensor failure,A. Alexiou;A. Manikas,Journal of the Franklin Institute,"The presence of uncertainties in the array response, due to sensors operational malfunctions and environmental effects, results in a performance degradation often greater than the application requirements can afford. Various attempts have been made to measure the effect of the presence of uncertainties on the performance of direction-finding (DF) algorithms and, moreover, several methods have been developed to either detect or partly rectify the resulting defects in performance and hence improve the robustness of the array system. However, the impact of sensor response uncertainties on the ultimate array DF capabilities, as they are determined by the array manifold characteristics, has not been considered thoroughly. In this paper, the sensitivity of array DF capabilities to sensor response errors is first formulated and investigated. Robustness and reliability measures are then proposed. Such measures can be used as tools for the evaluation of each sensor's importance within the array geometry and as criteria for the comparison of a number of array geometries."

We more generally handle the situation where several specified coefficients vary."
285,Is green energy expensive? Empirical evidence from the Spanish electricity market,A. Ciarreta;M. Espinosa;C. Pizarro-Irizar,Energy Policy,"Renewable energy promotion and its cost are at the heart of the energy policy debate in many countries. The question from an economic perspective is how expensive the promotion of renewable sources through price-based incentive schemes is. This paper addresses this issue empirically. We analyze the Spanish electricity market during the period 2008–2012, where renewable energy production rose by 57%. To determine how expensive it was, we first measure the savings due to the spot price reduction driven by the merit order effect and, second, we compute the amount paid as incentives to green energy by the electricity system; the difference between the two is the net cost of green energy to the electricity markets. We present aggregate results for renewable sources as a whole, as well as individual results for each technology. We show that at the initial stages, when renewable capacity was low, green energy promotion paid for itself (2008–2009); however, from 2010 on, when renewable production reached a relatively high level, it started to impose a positive net cost on the system. Finally, we found substantial differences among technologies: wind energy implied the lowest net cost, while solar photovoltaic was the most expensive."

Weinhardt,Journal of Physical Chemistry A,"The electronic structure of gas-phase methanol molecules (H3COH, H3COD, and D3COD) at atmospheric pressure was investigated using resonant inelastic soft X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the O K and C K edges. We observe strong changes of the relative emission intensities of all valence orbitals as a function of excitation energy, which can be related to the symmetries of the involved orbitals causing an angularly anisotropic RIXS intensity. Furthermore, all observed emission lines are subject to strong spectator shifts of up to −0.9 eV at the O K edge and up to −0.3 eV at the C K edge. At the lowest O K resonance, we find clear evidence for dissociation of the methanol molecule on the time scale of the RIXS process, which is illustrated by comparing X-ray emission spectra of regular and deuterated methanol."

Based on multi-D numerical simulations we describe which physical processes are at the origin of these large scale flows, how they are maintained and what sets their unique profiles. We also discuss how dynamo generated magnetic field may influence such a delicate dynamical balance and lead to a temporal modulation of the amplitude and profiles of the solar large scale flows."

Pileni,Nature Materials,"Nanocrystal organizations represent a new generation of materials with specific properties compared with those of isolated nanocrystals and of the bulk material. Here, we present the first intrinsic crystalline growth properties of highly ordered mono- and multilayers of 5 nm silver nanocrystals. Triangular single crystals with face-centred-cubic structures are obtained by annealing the ordered nanocrystals under atmospheric pressure at 50 ∘C. The triangles are mixed with well-crystallized coalesced particles of various shapes. Their size depends on the initial nanocrystal ordering range on the substrate, which is local on amorphous carbon and highly extended on highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG). Hence, the single-crystal size is larger on HOPG than on amorphous carbon. These observations show that the crystalline growth properties of silver nanocrystals can be tailored by controlling their organization. Furthermore, on HOPG an epitaxial orientation of the triangles is observed.Nanocrystal organizations represent a new generation of materials with specific properties compared with those of isolated nanocrystals and of the bulk material.

Boyer,ArXiv Computer Science,"This paper presents the METAL project, an ongoing French open Learning Analytics (LA) project for secondary school, that aims at improving the quality of the learning process. The originality of METAL is that it relies on research through exploratory activities and focuses on all the aspects of a Learning Analytics implementation. This large-scale project includes many concerns, divided into 4 main actions. (1) data management: multi-source data identification, collection and storage, selection and promotion of standards, and design and development of an open-source Learning Record Store (LRS); (2) data visualization: learner and teacher dashboards, with a design that relies on the co-conception with final users, including trust and usability concerns; (3) data exploitation: study of the link between gaze and memory of learners, design of explainable multi-source data-mining algorithms, including ethics and privacy concerns. An additional key of originality lies in the global dissemination of LA at an institution level or at a broader level such as a territory, at the opposite on many projects that focus on a specific school or a school curriculum. Each of these aspects is a hot topic in the literature. Taking into account all of them in a holistic view of education is an additional added value of the project."

293,Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Current Oil Sands Technologies: GHOST Model Development and Illustrative Application,A. Charpentier;O. Kofoworola;J. Bergerson;H. Maclean,Environmental Science & Technology,"A life cycle-based model, GHOST (GreenHouse gas emissions of current Oil Sands Technologies), which quantifies emissions associated with production of diluted bitumen and synthetic crude oil (SCO) is developed. GHOST has the potential to analyze a large set of process configurations, is based on confidential oil sands project operating data, and reports ranges of resulting emissions, improvements over prior studies, which primarily included a limited set of indirect activities, utilized theoretical design data, and reported point estimates. GHOST is demonstrated through application to a major oil sands process, steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). The variability in potential performance of SAGD technologies results in wide ranges of “well-to-refinery entrance gate” emissions (comprising direct and indirect emissions): 18–41 g CO2eq/MJ SCO, 9–18 g CO2eq/MJ dilbit, and 13–24 g CO2eq/MJ synbit. The primary contributor to SAGD’s emissions is the combustion of natural gas to produce process steam, making a project’s steam-to-oil ratio the most critical parameter in determining GHG performance. The demonstration (a) illustrates that a broad range of technology options, operating conditions, and resulting emissions exist among current oil sands operations, even when considering a single extraction technology, and (b) provides guidance about the feasibility of lowering SAGD project emissions."
294,Lipid Membranes Carrying Lipophilic Cholesterol-Based Oligonucleotides—Characterization and Application on Layer-by-Layer Coated Particles,A. Bunge;M. Loew;P. Pescador;A. Arbuzova;N. Brodersen;J. Kang;L. Dähne;J. Liebscher;A. Herrmann;G. Stengel;D. Huster,Journal of Physical Chemistry B,"Cholesterol-based lipophilic oligonucleotides incorporated into lipid membranes were studied using solid-state NMR, differential scanning calorimetry, and fluorescence methods. Lipophilic oligonucleotides can be used to build nanotechnological structures on membrane surfaces, taking advantage of the specific Watson−Crick base pairing. We used a cholesteryl-TEG anchor first described by Pfeiffer and Höök (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 10224−10225). The cholesterol-based anchor molecules were found to incorporate well into lipid membranes without disturbing the bilayer structure and dynamics. In contrast to cholesterol, which is known to induce significant condensation of the membrane lipids, the cholesteryl-TEG anchor does not display this property. When the cholesteryl-TEG moiety was covalently bound to an oligonucleotide, the resulting lipophilic DNA molecules inserted spontaneously into lipid membranes without altering their structure. The duplex formed by two complementary cholesteryl-TEG oligonucleotides had increased thermodynamic stability compared to the same oligonucleotides without the anchor, both in solution and incorporated into lipid membranes. Since the cholesteryl-TEG anchor lacks the characteristic properties of cholesterol, oligonucleotides modified with this anchor are equally distributed between liquid-disordered and liquid-ordered domains in “raft” forming membranes. As an example of an application of these lipophilic oligonucleotides, cholesteryl-TEG-DNA was incorporated into supported lipid bilayers formed on polyelectrolyte-coated silica microparticles. The modified oligonucleotides were stably inserted into the lipid membrane and retained their recognition properties, therefore enabling further functionalization of the particles."
295,"Lipophilic Oligonucleotides Spontaneously Insert into Lipid Membranes, Bind Complementary DNA Strands, and Sequester into Lipid-Disordered Domains",A. Bunge;A. Kurz;A. Windeck;T. Korte;W. Flasche;J. Liebscher;A. Herrmann;D. Huster,Langmuir,"For the development of surface functionalized bilayers, we have synthesized lipophilic oligonucleotides to combine the molecular recognition mechanism of nucleic acids and the self-assembly characteristics of lipids in planar membranes. A lipophilic oligonucleotide consisting of 21 thymidine units and two lipophilic nucleotides with an α-tocopherol moiety as a lipophilic anchor was synthesized using solid-phase methods with a phosphoramadite strategy. The interaction of the water soluble lipophilic oligonucleotide with vesicular lipid membranes and its capability to bind complementary DNA strands was studied using complementary methods such as NMR, EPR, DSC, fluorescence spectroscopy, and fluorescence microscopy. This oligonucleotide inserted stably into preformed membranes from the aqueous phase. Thereby, no significant perturbation of the lipid bilayer and its stability was observed. However, the non-lipidated end of the oligonucleotide is exposed to the aqueous environment, is relatively mobile, and is free to interact with complementary DNA strands. Binding of the complementary single-stranded DNA molecules is fast and accomplished by the formation of Watson−Crick base pairs, which was confirmed by 1H NMR chemical shift analysis and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The molecular structure of the membrane bound DNA double helix is very similar to the free double-stranded DNA. Further, the membrane bound DNA double strands also undergo regular melting. Finally, in raft-like membrane mixtures, the lipophilic oligonucleotide was shown to preferentially sequester into liquid-disordered membrane domains."
296,Live Weight Estimation of Donkeys in Central México from Measurement of Thoracic Circumference,A. Aluja;G. Pérez;F. López;R. Pearson,Tropical Animal Health and Production,"Body measurements (length from nape of neck to the withers; height to withers; length from withers to tail root; length from shoulder to tuber ischii; thoracic circumference; umbilical circumference) were taken and correlated with live weight from 160 donkeys (mean ± standard deviation = 6 ± 2.6 years old) in Central México. The age was assessed from dentition. Sex of the donkeys was also recorded. Sex was an important factor of variation (p = 0.011). Live weight was estimated using two allometric models. Model 1: Live weight = β o × (thoracic circumference)β1. Model 2: Live weight = β o × (height to the withers) βl × (thoracic circumference) β2. Separate prediction equations were produced for males and females, plus one for the total sampled. The ‘best fit’ models, were those using thoracic circumference to predict the live weight. Males: live weight = 0.018576 × (thoracic circumference)1.84107 (R 2 = 0.9839). Females: live weight = 0.031255 × (thoracic circumference)1.72888 (R 2 = 0.9839). The equations derived to estimate the live weight of donkeys in Britain, Morocco and Zimbabwe were less satisfactory for use with donkeys from Central México because they overestimated the live weight."

298,Low HIV-testing rates and awareness of HIV infection among high-risk heterosexual STI clinic attendees in The Netherlands,A. Bij;N. Dukers;R. Coutinho;H. Fennema,European Journal of Public Health,"Objectives: Since 1999, HIV testing is routinely offered to all attendees of the sexually transmitted infections (STI) outpatient clinic in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. This study evaluates whether this more active HIV-testing policy increased uptake of HIV testing and awareness of an HIV-positive serostatus among heterosexual attendees. Methods: In addition to routine data collected at each STI consultation, data from half-yearly HIV surveys were used from 1994 to 2004. During each survey period, 1000 consecutive attendees are enrolled voluntary and anonymously for HIV testing and are interviewed on previous HIV testing and outcome. Trends in and predictors for uptake of HIV testing as offered during routine STI consultation were analysed by logistic regression. Trends in awareness of an HIV-positive serostatus as obtained from the anonymous HIV surveys were likewise analysed. Results: The percentage of heterosexual attendees opting for an HIV test during consultation increased from 13% in 1996 to 56% in 2004. However, the proportion of individuals aware of their HIV infection did not change over time and only a minority (19%) of the 108 attendees found HIV-positive in the anonymous surveys were aware of their HIV infection. Persons being or visiting a commercial sex worker, having a non-Dutch ethnicity, lacking health insurance and having an STI diagnosed were less likely to opt for an HIV test. Conclusions: Although heterosexual attendees increased their uptake of HIV testing during STI consultation over time, uptake of testing by attendees at risk for HIV infection, such as those infected with an STI, remained low. As a result, the percentage of persons aware of their HIV infection remained low, posing a risk for their individual health and for ongoing HIV transmission. Current testing strategies, therefore, misses the group that most needs testing. Based on these results, ‘opt-out’ HIV testing is now the standard procedure at the Amsterdam STI clinic."
299,Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings After Percutaneous Irreversible Electroporation of Liver Metastases: A Systematic Longitudinal Study,A. Barabasch;M. Distelmaier;P. Heil;N. Krämer;C. Kuhl;P. Bruners,Investigative Radiology,"Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the course of magnetic resonance (MR) signal intensity (SI) changes that occur in noncirrhotic livers after irreversible electroporation (IRE) of liver metastases. Methods: This study is an institutional review board–approved prospective longitudinal follow-up study on 27 patients with 37 liver metastases who underwent computed tomography–guided percutaneous IRE and a standardized follow-up protocol by serial hepatic MR imaging studies that consisted of a gadobutrol-enhanced dynamic series, axial T2-weighted (T2w) turbo spin echo, and diffusion-weighted imaging ( b = 0/50/800), acquired before, within 2, and at 24 hours after IRE; at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks after IRE; and every 3 months thereafter for a follow-up of at least 12 months. Results: The ablated target lesion remained visible within the ablation zone in 23 (62%) of 37 of cases for a mean time of 21 ± 20 weeks (median, 12 weeks). The ablation zone appeared homogeneously hyperintense on T2w turbo spin echo images on the day of IRE in 37 of 37 cases. By 24 hours after IRE, the ablation zone inverted its SI in 35 of 37 cases to intermediately hypointense, with a rim of T2w bright SI that exhibited arterial phase enhancement; this persisted for 7 ± 5 weeks (median, 4 weeks). The rim resolved in 35 (95%) of 37 cases within 3 months. The ablation zone increased slightly over the first 48 hours, then shrank progressively. Complete healing of the ablation zone was observed in 57% (21/37) after an average of 14 ± 15 (median, 8 weeks). Average apparent diffusion coefficient values of the ablation zone decreased from 0.74 ± 0.36 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s pre-IRE to 0.63 ± 0.27 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s within the first 24 hours ( P < 0.05), followed by a progressive normalization to 0.91 ± 0.30 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s at 2 months. Conclusions: Knowledge of the broad spectrum of MR imaging findings after IRE is important to avoid diagnostic errors in the follow-up of patients after IRE."
300,Magnetic confinement of the solar tachocline,A. Brun;J. Zahn,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"Context.We study the physics of the solar tachocline (i.e. the thin transition layer between differential rotation in the convection zone and quasi uniform rotation in the radiative interior), and related MHD instabilities. Aims.We have performed 3D MHD simulations of the solar radiative interior to check whether a fossil magnetic field is able to prevent the spread of the tachocline.Methods.Starting with a purely poloidal magnetic field and a latitudinal shear meant to be imposed by the convection zone at the top of the radiation zone, we have investigated the interactions between magnetic fields, rotation and shear, using the spectral code ASH on massively parallel supercomputers.Results.In all cases we have explored, the fossil field diffuses outward and ends up connecting with the convection zone, whose differential rotation is then imprinted at latitudes above ≈ throughout the radiative interior, according to Ferraro's law of isorotation. Rotation remains uniform in the lower latitude region which is contained within closed field lines. We find that the meridional flow cannot stop the inward progression of the differential rotation. Further, we observe the development of non-axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, first due to the initial poloidal configuration of the fossil field, and later to the toroidal field produced by shearing the poloidal field through the differential rotation. We do not find dynamo action as such in the radiative interior, since the mean poloidal field is not regenerated. But the instability persists during the whole evolution, while slowly decaying with the mean poloidal field; it is probably sustained by small departures from isorotation.Conclusions.According to our numerical simulations, a fossil magnetic field cannot prevent the radiative spread of the tachocline, and thus it is unable to enforce uniform rotation in the radiation zone. Neither can the observed thinness of that layer be invoked as a proof for such an internal fossil magnetic field."
301,"Magnetism, dynamo action and the solar-stellar connection",A. Brun;M. Browning,Living Reviews in Solar Physics,"The Sun and other stars are magnetic: magnetism pervades their interiors and affects their evolution in a variety of ways. In the Sun, both the fields themselves and their influence on other phenomena can be uncovered in exquisite detail, but these observations sample only a moment in a single star’s life. By turning to observations of other stars, and to theory and simulation, we may infer other aspects of the magnetism—e.g., its dependence on stellar age, mass, or rotation rate—that would be invisible from close study of the Sun alone. Here, we review observations and theory of magnetism in the Sun and other stars, with a partial focus on the “Solar-stellar connection”: i.e., ways in which studies of other stars have influenced our understanding of the Sun and vice versa. We briefly review techniques by which magnetic fields can be measured (or their presence otherwise inferred) in stars, and then highlight some key observational findings uncovered by such measurements, focusing (in many cases) on those that offer particularly direct constraints on theories of how the fields are built and maintained. We turn then to a discussion of how the fields arise in different objects: first, we summarize some essential elements of convection and dynamo theory, including a very brief discussion of mean-field theory and related concepts. Next we turn to simulations of convection and magnetism in stellar interiors, highlighting both some peculiarities of field generation in different types of stars and some unifying physical processes that likely influence dynamo action in general. We conclude with a brief summary of what we have learned, and a sampling of issues that remain uncertain or unsolved."
302,Managing organizational knowledge as a strategic asset,A. Bollinger;R. Smith,Journal of Knowledge Management,"Knowledge is a resource that is valuable to an organization’s ability to innovate and compete. It exists within the individual employees, and also in a composite sense within the organization. According to the resource‐based view of the firm (RBV), strategic assets are the critical determinants of an organization’s ability to maintain a sustainable competitive advantage. This paper will combine RBV theory with characteristics of knowledge to show that organizational knowledge is a strategic asset. Knowledge management is discussed frequently in the literature as a mechanism for capturing and disseminating the knowledge that exists within the organization. This paper will also explain practical considerations for implementation of knowledge management principles."
303,Mapping 245 SSR markers on the Vitis vinifera genome: a tool for grape genetics,A. Adam-Blondon;C. Roux;D. Claux;G. Butterlin;D. Merdinoglu;P. This,Theoretical and Applied Genetics,"The aim of the present work was to develop a microsatellite marker-based map of the Vitis vinifera genome (n=19), useful for genetic studies in this perennial heterozygous species, as SSR markers are highly transferable co-dominant markers. A total of 346 primer pairs were tested on the two parents (Syrah and Grenache) of a full sib population of 96 individuals (S × G population), successfully amplifying 310 markers. Of these, 88.4% markers were heterozygous for at least one of the two parents. A total of 292 primer pairs were then tested on Riesling, the parent of the RS1 population derived from selfing (96 individuals), successfully amplifying 299 markers among which 207 (62.9%) were heterozygous. Only 6.7% of the markers were homozygous in all three genotypes, stressing the interest of such markers in grape genetics. Four maps were constructed based on the segregation of 245 SSR markers in the two populations. The Syrah map was constructed from the segregations of 177 markers that could be ordered into 19 linkage groups (total length 1,172.2 cM). The Grenache map was constructed with the segregations of 178 markers that could be ordered into 18 linkage groups (total length 1,360.6 cM). The consensus S × G map was constructed with the segregations of 220 markers that were ordered into 19 linkage groups (total length 1,406.1 cM). One hundred and eleven markers were scored on the RS1 population, among them 27 that were not mapped using the S × G map. Out of these 111 markers, 110 allowed to us to construct a map of a total length of 1,191.7 cM. Using these four maps, the genome length of V. vinifera was estimated to be around 2,200 cM. The present work allowed us to map 123 new SSR markers on the V. vinifera genome that had not been ordered in a previous SSR-based map (Riaz et al. 2004), representing an average of 6.5 new markers per linkage group. Any new SSR marker mapped is of great potential usefulness for many applications such as the transfer of well-scattered markers to other maps for QTL detection, the use of markers in specific regions for the fine mapping of genes/QTL, or for the choice of markers for MAS."
304,"Mass Distribution Analysis of Spheroid Manuports, Spheroid Artifacts, and the Lithics of Play Learning",A. Cannell,Lithic Technology,"The mass distribution of the natural spheroids (manuports) from the Cave of Hearths, South Africa, is examined and found to empirically match a Poisson-type histogram with an average of 533 g. The stature of the (male) hominins that hoarded this cache is modeled at 181 cm, compatible with the fossil record for this region and period. This empirical distribution is shown to be partly a consequence of a visual selection of throwing material. The ethnological case of the war stones from the Niue Islands is examined in terms of their use and mass, showing that their distribution is similar to that of the Cave of Hearths and validating the interpretation that these manuports were collected for throwing. An examination of other spheroid artifacts reveals similar mass distributions, indicating that they also may have been made for throwing (or that our attraction to good throwing material determined their mass). The surprisingly overlooked question of play-learning is discussed, together with the possibility that smaller stones and artifacts were hoarded by juveniles at certain sites."
305,Mass Transfer and Volume Changes in French Fries During Air Frying,A. Andrés;Á. Arguelles;M. Castelló;A. Heredia,Food and Bioprocess Technology,"The production of healthier fried foods requires the adaptation of industrial processes. In this context, air frying is an alternative to deep oil frying to obtain French fries with lower fat content. Kinetic analysis of compositional changes and main fluxes involved in air frying were carried out, and the results were compared to those obtained for deep oil frying. The influence of the type of sample (unpretreated, frozen, or blanched potatoes) was also analyzed. The results showed that oil uptake is much lower in air frying although a much longer processing time is required. Also, water loss and thus the loss of volume were much higher in air frying compared to the conventional process."
306,Meandering bed development time: Formulation and related experimental testing,A. Binns;A. Silva,Advances in Water Resources,"This paper concerns the prediction of the bed development time of alluvial meandering streams. It is assumed that the stream centreline follows a sine-generated curve; the banks are rigid; the flow is turbulent and subcritical; and the width-to-depth ratio is “large”. The bed is flat at the beginning of an “experiment”. The bed development consists of the formation of large-scale, laterally adjacent pool-bar complexes strictly induced by the stream curvature. The paper is to be viewed as an extension of previous work by the writers, who have introduced an equation for the aforementioned bed development time, albeit with a proportionality factor that remains a not yet known function of the stream initial deflection angle. The objective of this paper is to reveal this function, and thus bring the equation for the bed development time into a form suitable for practical applications. This is achieved on the basis of a series of experiments carried out by the writers in three sine-generated meandering streams of varying sinuosity, as well as data from the literature. The paper concludes with examples of application of the resulting equation to real rivers."
307,Measuring Physical Activity of Older Adults via Smartwatch and Stigmergic Receptive Fields,A. Alfeo;M. Cimino;G. Vaglini,ArXiv Computer Science,"Physical activity level (PAL) in older adults can enhance healthy aging,improve functional capacity, and prevent diseases. It is known that humanannotations of PAL can be affected by subjectivity and inaccuracy. Recentlydeveloped smart devices can allow a non-invasive, analytic, and continuousgathering of physiological signals. We present an innovative computationalsystem fed by signals of heartbeat rate, wrist motion and pedometer sensed by asmartwatch. More specifically, samples of each signal are aggregated byfunctional structures called trails. The trailing process is inspired bystigmergy, an insects' coordination mechanism, and is managed by computationalunits called stigmergic receptive fields (SRFs). SRFs, which compute thesimilarity between trails, are arranged in a stigmergic perceptron to detect acollection of micro-behaviours of the raw signal, called archetypes. A SRF isadaptive to subjects: its structural parameters are tuned by a differentialevolution algorithm. SRFs are used in a multilayer architecture, providingfurther levels of processing to realize macro analyses in the applicationdomain. As a result, the architecture provides a daily PAL, useful to detectbehavioural shift indicating initial signs of disease or deviations inperformance. As a proof of concept, the approach has been experimented on threesubjects."
308,Measuring variety reduction along the supply chain: The variety gap model,A. Brun;M. Pero,International Journal of Production Economics,"To meet the demand for variety, many firms widen their product ranges, increasing not only revenues but also operational inefficiencies. Managerial choices can mitigate the negative effects on costs, but they also limit the ability of a firm to deliver variety to the market within the timeframe and costs requested by clients. Therefore, the variety actually offered in the market can be different from the level of variety that had been defined during, for instance, product development. We call the series of decisions whose interaction results in the variety actually distributed in the market the “process of variety reduction”. This paper introduces a descriptive model of this process. The model has been applied to a real case to highlight the main variety reduction decisions."
309,Mechanism of Enhanced HIV Restriction by Virion Coencapsidated Cytidine Deaminases APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G,A. Ara;R. Love;T. Follack;K. Ahmed;M. Adolph;L. Chelico,Journal of Virology,"The APOBEC3 (A3) enzymes, A3G and A3F, are coordinately expressed in CD4+ T cells and can become coencapsidated into HIV-1 virions, primarily in the absence of the viral infectivity factor (Vif). A3F and A3G are deoxycytidine deaminases that inhibit HIV-1 replication by inducing guanine-to-adenine hypermutation through deamination of cytosine to form uracil in minus-strand DNA. The effect of the simultaneous presence of both A3G and A3F on HIV-1 restriction ability is not clear. Here, we used a single-cycle infectivity assay and biochemical analyses to determine if coencapsidated A3G and A3F differ in their restriction capacity from A3G or A3F alone. Proviral DNA sequencing demonstrated that compared to each A3 enzyme alone, A3G and A3F, when combined, had a coordinate effect on hypermutation. Using size exclusion chromatography, rotational anisotropy, and in vitro deamination assays, we demonstrate that A3F promotes A3G deamination activity by forming an A3F/G hetero-oligomer in the absence of RNA which is more efficient at deaminating cytosines. Further, A3F caused the accumulation of shorter reverse transcripts due to decreasing reverse transcriptase efficiency, which would leave single-stranded minus-strand DNA exposed for longer periods of time, enabling more deamination events to occur. Although A3G and A3F are known to function alongside each other, these data provide evidence for an A3F/G hetero-oligomeric A3 with unique properties compared to each individual counterpart.IMPORTANCE The APOBEC3 enzymes APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G act as a barrier to HIV-1 replication in the absence of the HIV-1 Vif protein. After APOBEC3 enzymes are encapsidated into virions, they deaminate cytosines in minus-strand DNA, which forms promutagenic uracils that induce transition mutations or proviral DNA degradation. Even in the presence of Vif, footprints of APOBEC3-catalyzed deaminations are found, demonstrating that APOBEC3s still have discernible activity against HIV-1 in infected individuals. We undertook a study to better understand the activity of coexpressed APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G. The data demonstrate that an APOBEC3F/APOBEC3G hetero-oligomer can form that has unique properties compared to each APOBEC3 alone. This hetero-oligomer has increased efficiency of virus hypermutation, raising the idea that we still may not fully realize the antiviral mechanisms of endogenous APOBEC3 enzymes. Hetero-oligomerization may be a mechanism to increase their antiviral activity in the presence of Vif."
310,Mesoscopic magnetomechanical hysteresis in a magnetorheological elastomer,A. Biller;O. Stolbov;Y. Raikher,Physical Review E,"Field-induced magnetostatic interaction in a pair of identical particles made of a magnetically soft ferromagnet is studied. It is shown that due to saturation of the ferromagnet magnetization, this case differs significantly from the (super)paramagnetic one. A numerical solution is given, discussed, and compared with that provided by a simpler model (nonlinear mutual dipoles). We show that for multidomain ferromagnetic particles embedded in an elastomer matrix, as for paramagnetic ones in the same environment, pair clusters may form or break by a hysteresis scenario. However, the magnetization saturation brings in important features to this effect. First, the bistability state and the hysteresis take place only in a limited region of the material parameters of the system. Second, along with the hysteresis jumps occurring under the sole influence of the field, the “latent” hysteresis is possible which realizes only if the action of the field is combined with some additional (nonmagnetic) external factor. The obtained conditions, when used to assess the possibility of clustering in real magnetorheological polymers, infer an important role of mesoscopic magnetomechanical hysteresis for the macroscopic properties of these composites."
311,"Metabolic bone disease of prematurity: causes, recognition, prevention, treatment and long-term consequences",A. Chinoy;M. Mughal;R. Padidela,Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition,"Metabolic bone disease of prematurity (MBDP) is characterised by skeletal demineralisation, and in severe cases it can result in fragility fractures of long bones and ribs during routine handling. MBDP arises from prenatal and postnatal factors. Infants who are born preterm are deprived of fetal mineral accumulation, 80% of which occurs in the third trimester. Postnatally, it is difficult to maintain a comparable intake of minerals, and medications, such as corticosteroids and diuretic therapy, lead to bone resorption. With improvements in neonatal care and nutrition, the incidence of MBDP in preterm infants appears to have decreased, although the recent practice of administering phosphate supplements alone will result in secondary hyperparathyroidism and associated bone loss, worsening MBDP. Postnatal immobilisation and loss of placental supply of oestrogen also contribute to skeletal demineralisation. There is no single diagnostic or screening test for MBDP, with pitfalls existing for most radiological and biochemical investigations. By reviewing the pathophysiology of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, one can establish that plasma parathyroid hormone is important in determining the aetiology of MBDP – primarily calcipaenia or phosphopaenia. This will then direct treatment with the appropriate supplements while considering optimal physiological calcium to phosphate ratios."

313,MicroRNA mimics that target the placental renin–angiotensin system inhibit trophoblast proliferation,A. Arthurs;E. Lumbers;K. Pringle,Molecular Human Reproduction,"In early gestation, the human placental renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is upregulated and plays a role in placental development. Among other functions, signalling through the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) initiates proliferation. Many microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting placental RAS mRNAs are downregulated at this time. We propose that in early gestation miRNAs that target the placental RAS are downregulated, allowing for the increased RAS expression and proliferation required for adequate placentation. HTR-8/SVneo cells (an immortalized human trophoblast cell line) were used to assess the effect of nine miRNA mimics (at 0.08, 0.16, 0.32 and 0.64 ng/μL) on trophoblast cell proliferation and predicted RAS target mRNAs. The effect of the miRNA mimics on the rate of cell proliferation was assessed using the xCELLigence real-time cell analysis system over 48 h. Levels of miRNAs and predicted RAS target mRNAs were determined by RT-PCR (qPCR, n = 9/group). Statistically different levels of expression were determined (P &lt; 0.05). All nine miRNA mimics significantly affected the proliferation rates of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Five of the miRNA mimics (miR-181a-5p (predicted to target: renin (REN), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)), miR-378 (REN, ACE), miR-663 (REN), miR-483-3p (ACE, ACE2, angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1)) and miR-514 (AGT)) were associated with a dose-dependent reduction in cell proliferation. Seven of the mimics significantly decreased expression of at least one of their predicted target RAS mRNAs. Our study shows that miRNAs targeting placental RAS mRNAs play a role in controlling trophoblast proliferation. As placentation is largely a process of proliferation, changes in expression of these miRNAs may be partly responsible for the expression of the placental RAS, proliferation and placentation."
314,Microarray based analysis of temperature and oxidative stress induced messenger RNA in Schistosoma mansoni,A. Aragon;R. Imani;V. Blackburn;C. Cunningham,Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology,"The body's defense against schistosome infection can take many forms. For example, upon developing acute schistosomiasis, patients often have fever coinciding with larval maturation, migration and early oviposition. As the infection becomes established, the parasite comes under oxidative stress generated by the host immune system. The most common treatment for schistosomiasis is the anti-helminthic drug praziquantel. Its effectiveness, however, is limited due to its inability to kill schistosomes 2–4 weeks post-infection. Clearly there is a need for new anti-schistosomal drugs. We hypothesize that gene products expressed as part of a protective response against heat and/or oxidative stress are potential therapeutic targets for future drug development. Using a 12,166 element oligonucleotide microarray to characterize Schistosoma mansoni genes induced by heat and oxidative stress we found that 1878 S. mansoni elements were significantly induced by heat stress. These included previously reported heat-shock genes expressing homologs of HSP40, HSP70 and HSP86. One thousand and one elements were induced by oxidative stress including those expressing homologs of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Seventy-two elements were common to both stressors and could potentially be exploited in the development of novel anti-schistosomal therapeutics.The body's defense against schistosome infection can take many forms.

315,Microwave Maceration of Pinot Noir Grape Must: Sanitation and Extraction Effects and Wine Phenolics Outcomes,A. Carew;A. Sparrow;C. Curtin;D. Close;R. Dambergs,Food and Bioprocess Technology,"Pinot noir grapes have a unique phenolic profile which can impinge on the extraction and stabilisation of compounds such as anthocyanins and tannins which contribute to the colour and mouthfeel of red wine. This study examined the concentration of phenolic compounds in Pinot noir grape must and wine following application of a novel microwave maceration treatment for red grape must. Microwave maceration was shown to be highly effective for extraction of phenolics from grape solids into grape juice. When juices were fermented to wine, ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry showed microwave maceration was associated with significantly higher concentrations of total phenolics, anthocyanin, tannin and pigmented tannin in wine at 18 months bottle age, compared with control wine. Mean tannin concentration in microwave treatment wine was 0.60 gm/L at 18 months, compared with 0.14 gm/L in control wine. The microwave treatment was also associated with a substantial and rapid decrease in the grape-associated yeast population, compared with control maceration, and a shorter lag phase at the outset of alcoholic fermentation. Based on this study, microwave maceration warrants further investigation as a potential industrial-scale application in red winemaking."
316,Milk production and grazing behaviour responses of Alpine dairy goats to daily access time to pasture or to daily pasture allowance on temperate pastures in spring,A. Charpentier;R. Delagarde,Small Ruminant Research,"In a context of price volatility and low feed self-sufficiency of goat farms in Western Europe, grazing may play an important role. Knowledge about the impact of grazing management – particularly daily access time to pasture or pasture allowance – on dairy goats’ performance is scarce. Two 3-week trials were carried out in spring with 36 Alpine goats in mid-lactation. In Trial 1, 3 access times to pasture during daytime (AT: 4, 6 or 8 h/day, from 08:00 to 12:00, from 10:00 to 16:00 and from 08:00 to 16:00, respectively) were compared. In each treatment, goats individually received 370 g DM of dehydrated forage (lucerne and maize) after the evening milking, 278 g DM of concentrate twice daily, at each milking, and a daily pasture allowance of 2.0 kg DM/goat, measured at 4 cm above ground level. In Trial 2, 3 daily pasture allowances (PA: 1.6, 2.3 or 3.0 kg DM/goat, measured at 4 cm above ground level) were compared. Goats individually received 278 g DM of concentrate twice daily, at each milking, and access time to pasture was of 13 h/d (from 07:30 to 16:00 and from 17:00 to 21:30). Milk production was similar between medium and high levels of AT or PA, and was lower for the lowest level of AT or PA (−300 g/d at the lowest AT and −500 g/d at the lowest PA). Milk fat and protein concentrations only slightly varied between the different levels of AT or PA. In both trials, goats maintained an intense grazing activity. Grazing time (from 240 to 540 min/d) and proportion of time spent grazing (from 66 to 99%) were mainly affected by AT, and only marginally by PA."
317,Milk substrates influence proteolytic activity of Pseudomonas fluorescens strains,A. Colantuono;P. D'Incecco;M. Fortina;V. Rosi;L. Pellegrino,Food Control,"Pseudomonas fluorescens spoiling raw milk produces a heat-stable protease, namely AprX, that may degrade k-casein with a chymosin-like activity thus causing gelation of commercial milk during storage. Four strains of P. fluorescens were selected for both the presence of aprX gene and proteolytic activity in milk agar plate (a negative control was included) and were incubated in various milk substrates, i.e. pasteurized milk, UHT milk and reconstituted milk powder, differing for heat-treatment and presence of fat, in order to evaluate whether the type of milk substrates could affect their growth and proteolytic activity. While bacterial growth was mainly influenced by temperature (4 or 25 °C) for all strains, HPLC and CZE patterns of incubated milk samples showed that the extent and trend of proteolysis were highly heterogeneous and not exclusively strain-dependent. Indeed, pasteurized milk was the only substrate where aprX-positive strains led to gelation onset whereas other milk types underwent different destabilization. Ultrastructural features observed by transmission electron microscopy for casein micelles, whey proteins and fat globules, where present, explained how the processing conditions, sometimes including repeated heat-treatments, may have influenced the extent of proteolysis operated by P. fluorescens strains in the tested milk substrates. This study has highlighted that different milk substrates may bring to different conclusions when used in experiments aiming to elucidate the mechanisms of bacterial proteolysis since both ultrastructural and compositional properties may impact on accessibility of cleavage sites to proteases."

Bergaoui,Microporous and Mesoporous Materials,"The hydrothermal synthesis of Mn-analcime was performed by mixing manganese(II) carbonate, silicic acid and aluminum nitrate in a basic medium in the 120–175 °C temperature range for 6–72 h. Different Mn/Al ratios were used. The obtained samples were characterized by powder XRD, N2 physical adsorption analysis, TGA/DTA, transmission electron microscopy, elemental analysis, IR, XPS, EPR and 29Si and 27Al MAS-NMR spectroscopies. Manganese is probably mostly in the +IV oxidation state and partly substitutes silicon in the zeolite framework. The catalytic properties of Mn-analcime were evaluated in the cyclohexene oxidation reaction and highlight an interesting activity of this material, together with a good recyclability, which make it a promising catalyst for selective oxidation reactions."
320,Modeling Contra-Rotating Turbomachinery Components for Engine Performance Simulations: The Geared Turbofan With Contra-Rotating Core Case,A. Alexiou;I. Roumeliotis;N. Aretakis;A. Tsalavoutas;K. Mathioudakis,Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power,"This paper presents a method of modeling contra-rotating turbomachinery components for engine performance simulations. The first step is to generate the performance characteristics of such components. In this study, suitably modified one-dimensional mean line codes are used. The characteristics are then converted to three-dimensional tables (maps). Compared to conventional turbomachinery component maps, the speed ratio between the two shafts is included as an additional map parameter and the torque ratio as an additional table. Dedicated component models are then developed that use these maps to simulate design and off-design operation at the component and engine levels. Using this approach, a performance model of a geared turbofan with a contra-rotating core (CRC) is created. This configuration was investigated in the context of the European program “NEW Aero-Engine Core Concepts” (NEWAC). The core consists of a seven-stage compressor and a two-stage turbine without interstage stators and with successive rotors running in the opposite direction through the introduction of a rotating outer spool. Such a configuration results in a reduced parts count, length, weight, and cost of the entire high pressure (HP) system. Additionally, the core efficiency is improved due to reduced cooling air flow requirements. The model is then coupled to an aircraft performance model and a typical mission is carried out. The results are compared against those of a similar configuration employing a conventional core and identical design point performance. For the given aircraft-mission combination and assuming a 10% engine weight saving when using the CRC arrangement over the conventional one, a total fuel burn reduction of 1.1% is predicted."
321,Modeling earthquake dynamics,A. Charpentier;M. Durand,Journal of Seismology,"In this paper, we investigate questions arising in Parsons and Geist (Bull Seismol Soc Am 102:1–11, 2012). Pseudo causal models connecting magnitudes and waiting times are considered, through generalized regression. We do use conditional model (magnitude given previous waiting time, and conversely) as an extension to joint distribution model described in Nikoloulopoulos and Karlis (Environmetrics 19: 251–269, 2008). On the one hand, we fit a Pareto distribution for earthquake magnitudes, where the tail index is a function of waiting time following previous earthquake; on the other hand, waiting times are modeled using a Gamma or a Weibull distribution, where parameters are functions of the magnitude of the previous earthquake. We use those two models, alternatively, to generate the dynamics of earthquake occurrence, and to estimate the probability of occurrence of several earthquakes within a year or a decade."
322,Modeling realized volatility on the Spanish intra-day electricity market,A. Ciarreta;A. Zarraga,Energy Economics,"This paper models the realized volatility of the hourly prices from the six sessions of the Spanish intra-day electricity market for the period 2002–2014. Based on the sequential organization of the market, a model in which realized volatility depends on its own past and that of the other sessions is specified and then modified in two ways. On the one hand, total variation is decomposed into jump and non-jump components and on the other hand EGARCH innovations are considered. Estimation results show significant volatility transmissions between the sessions. Out-of-sample forecast criteria select EGARCH innovations for sessions 1 and 2, while simpler models with no EGARCH innovations and no jump distinction are preferred for sessions 5 and 6. We argue how results are driven by the market structure, the market design and the regulation of renewable generation."
323,"Modelling massive sulphate aerosol pollution, following the large 1783 Laki basaltic eruption",A. Chenet;F. Fluteau;V. Courtillot,Earth and Planetary Science Letters,"The climatic impact of volcanic eruptions depends mainly on the amount of sulphur-rich gases released into the stratosphere. These are rapidly converted to sulphate aerosols, which result in cooling of the lower troposphere and warming of the lower stratosphere. These gases are retained in the stratosphere and then concentrated by atmospheric processes, forming acid fog near the Earth's surface, with potentially dramatic environmental consequences on plants, animals and humans. We have modelled such emissions in the case of the unusually large 1783–1784 basaltic fissure eruption of Laki (Iceland), using an Atmospheric General Circulation Model. Results show good agreement with historical observations, such as typical time taken by individual pulses to reach continental Europe or geographical extent of the deadly haze that covered much of the northern hemisphere. The model could be adjusted to predict the climatic consequences of very large eruptions, up to the scale of massive flood basalts, and test the proposal that these are the main agent in most mass extinctions of life on Earth.The climatic impact of volcanic eruptions depends mainly on the amount of sulphur-rich gases released into the stratosphere.

324,"Modelling of transport and biogeochemical processes in pollution plumes: Vejen landfill, Denmark",A. Brun;P. Engesgaard;T. Christensen;D. Rosbjerg,Journal of Hydrology,"A biogeochemical transport code is used to simulate leachate attenuation, biogeochemical processes, and development of redox zones in a pollution plume downstream of the Vejen landfill in Denmark. Calibration of the degradation parameters resulted in a good agreement with the observed distribution in the plume of a number of species, such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Fe2+, NO3−, HCO3−, SO42−, CH4, and pH. The simulated redox zones agree with observations confirming that the Fe-reducing zone played an important role in the attenuation of the DOC plume. Effective first-order rate constants for every redox zone were determined giving DOC half-lives ranging from 100 to 1–2 days going from the methanogenic to the aerobic zone. The order of decrease in DOC half-lives from the anaerobic to the aerobic zone corresponds to findings at other landfills."
325,Modelling of transport and biogeochemical processes in pollution plumes: literature review and model development,A. Brun;P. Engesgaard,Journal of Hydrology,"A literature survey shows how biogeochemical (coupled organic and inorganic reaction processes) transport models are based on considering the complete biodegradation process as either a single- or as a two-step process. It is demonstrated that some two-step process models rely on the Partial Equilibrium Approach (PEA). The PEA assumes the organic degradation step, and not the electron acceptor consumption step, is rate limiting. This distinction is not possible in one-step process models, where consumption of both the electron donor and acceptor are treated kinetically. A three-dimensional, two-step PEA model is developed. The model allows for Monod kinetics and biomass growth, features usually included only in one-step process models. The biogeochemical part of the model is tested for a batch system with degradation of organic matter under the consumption of a sequence of electron acceptors. A second paper [J. Hydrol. 256 (2002) 230–249], reports the application of the model to a field study of biogeochemical transport processes in a landfill plume in Denmark (Vejen)."
326,Modelling the mercury removal from polluted waters by using TOMAC microcapsules considering the metal speciation,A. Borreguero;A. Leura;J. Rodríguez;O. Vaselli;M. Carmona,Chemical Engineering Journal,"An innovative approach to remove mercury from Hg-rich ground-waters of the Abbadia San Salvatore Hg-mining area (Italy) using microcapsules containing trioctyl-methyl-ammonium-chloride (MC-TOMAC) is presented. Waters from three selected locations with mercury concentrations between 1.43 and 256.8 μg L−1 were studied. MC-TOMAC demonstrated high selectivity for mercury, being able to remove it entirely from ground waters in presence of relatively high concentrations of another anions in only one contact step. Besides, MC-TOMAC were able to satisfactorily remove the total mercury from ground waters when the mass ratio of mercury to MC-TOMAC was lower than 0.102 mgHg gMC-TOMAC−1 at pH 1, while up to 99.0 ± 2.0% of mercury was removed at natural pH. The relationship between the liquid and solid that can be treated in one contact step and a countercurrent contact in order to agree with the Council Directive 98/83/EC were stablished for one of the studied ground waters (S2). Additionally, a mathematical model based on the ideal mass action law in the solid phase and considering the metal speciation and their equilibriums in the liquid phase depending on the pH and chloride concentration was developed. Experimental extraction results were successfully fitted with the model, obtaining a value of the two unknown parameters, K{IE1} and K{IE2}, of 13622.5 and 2269.9 kg L−1; which represent the ion exchange equilibrium constants for the mercury uptake by MC-TOMAC for the species HgCl3-and HgCl42-, respectively. Besides, this model allowed to simulate the solid-liquid equilibrium curves at different pH values and chloride concentrations, indicating the suitable conditions to achieve the process."
327,Modification of Nanocellulose with a Xyloglucan–RGD Conjugate Enhances Adhesion and Proliferation of Endothelial Cells: Implications for Tissue Engineering,A. Bodin;L. Ahrenstedt;H. Fink;H. Brumer;B. Risberg;P. Gatenholm,Biomacromolecules,"This paper describes a novel method for introducing the RGD cell adhesion peptide to enhance cell adhesion onto bacterial cellulose (BC). BC and cotton linters as reference were modified with xyloglucan (XG) and xyloglugan bearing a GRGDS pentapeptide. The adsorptions followed Langmuir adsorption behavior, where both XGs probably decorate the cellulose surfaces as a monolayer. The adsorption maximum of the XGs reached around 180 mg/g on BC and only about three times as much on cotton linters. The adsorption was verified with colorimetric methods. The specific surface area of BC measured with XG and XG-GRGDS was about 200 m2/g and was almost three times less for cotton linters, 60 m2/g. The difference in the amounts of XGs adsorbed might be explained by the swollen network of bacterial cellulose and a more exposed and accessible bulk as compared to cotton linters. The nanocellulose material was modified homogeneously throughout the material, as seen by the z-scan in confocal microscopy. Moreover, the modification in the water phase, in comparison with organic solvents, was clearly advantageous for preserving the morphology, as observed with SEM. The modification slightly increased the wettability, which might explain the decrease in or undetectable adsorption of adhesive protein shown by QCM-D. Initial cell studies showed that adhesion of human endothelial cells is enhanced when the BC hydrogel is modified with XG-GRGDS. QCM-D studies further revealed that the cell enhancement is due to the presence of the RGD epitope on XG and not to a nonspecific adsorption of fibronectin from cell culture medium. Optimization and proliferation studies of human endothelial cells onto bacterial cellulose modified with XG-GRGDS are currently being carried out at the Vascular Engineering Center, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg."
328,Modulation of IGF-Binding Protein-2 and -3 in Hyperoxic Injury in Developing Rat Lung,A. Chetty;N. Manzo;A. Waxman;H. Nielsen,Pediatric Research,"Retinoids play an important role in lung development and repair. We showed that retinoic acid (RA) inhibits O2-induced fibroblast proliferation in rat lung explants. IGF-1, which enhances the proliferation of human fetal lung fibroblasts and stimulates collagen production during lung injury, has an important role in the lung injury/repair process. Interactions of IGF-1 with its receptor are modulated by IGF-binding proteins IGFBPs. We hypothesized that RA alters IGFBP-2 and -3 in hyperoxia-exposed neonatal lung and alters collagen production. Neonatal rat lungs were cultured in room air or 95% O2 and 5% CO2 for 3 d with or without RA. IGFBP-2 and -3 were measured both in culture medium and in lung tissue. Type I collagen and procollagen propeptide were analyzed in the lung tissue. Hyperoxia induced an increase in type I collagen that was significantly inhibited in the presence of RA. IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 in the lungs were decreased in hyperoxia but significantly increased in hyperoxia plus RA. In the culture medium, IGFBP-2 and -3 were not increased with hyperoxia but significantly increased in the presence of RA plus hyperoxia. There was no increase in IGFBP-3 RNA transcript after RA treatment in either room air or O2 exposure. In conclusion, RA modulates the secreted IGFBP-2 and -3 during O2 exposure and inhibits the increase in collagen that occurs during lung injury. We speculate that RA protects against O2-induced neonatal lung injury through modulation of the IGFBPs.Retinoids play an important role in lung development and repair.

Kechaou,Food Chemistry,"The aims of this work were to determine chemical composition and sorption isotherms of Tunisian orange peel and leaves of the “Maltaise” variety. These by-products were found to be rich in fibre, soluble sugars, protein, minerals and phenols. The equilibrium moisture contents of “Maltaise” peel and leaves were measured using the static gravimetric method at three temperatures (40, 50 and 60 °C) and in wide range of water activity (0.109–0.891). Desorption and adsorption data of peel and leaves were best fitted by the Peleg model at 40, 50 and 60 °C. The net isosteric heats of desorption and adsorption were determined from sorption isotherms. For both peel and leaves, the net isosteric heat of desorption was higher than the net isosteric heat of adsorption and both decreased continuously with increasing of the equilibrium moisture content.The aims of this work were to determine chemical composition and sorption isotherms of Tunisian orange peel and leaves of the “Maltaise” variety.

330,Molecular Orientation of Tropoelastin is Determined by Surface Hydrophobicity,A. Brun;J. Chow;D. Bax;A. Nelson;A. Weiss;M. James,Biomacromolecules,"Tropoelastin is the precursor of the extracellular protein elastin and is utilized in tissue engineering and implant technology by adapting the interface presented by surface-bound tropoelastin. The preferred orientation of the surface bound protein is relevant to biointerface interactions, as the C-terminus of tropoelastin is known to be a binding target for cells. Using recombinant human tropoelastin we monitored the binding of tropoelastin on hydrophilic silica and on silica made hydrophobic by depositing a self-assembled monolayer of octadecyl trichlorosilane. The layered organization of deposited tropoelastin was probed using neutron and X-ray reflectometry under aqueous and dried conditions. In a wet environment, tropoelastin retained a solution-like structure when adsorbed on silica but adopted a brush-like structure when on hydrophobized silica. The orientation of the surface-bound tropoelastin was investigated using cell binding assays and it was found that the C-terminus of tropoelastin faced the bulk solvent when bound to the hydrophobic surface, but a mixture of orientations was adopted when tropoelastin was bound to the hydrophilic surface. Drying the tropoelastin-coated surfaces irreversibly altered these protein structures for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces."
331,Molecular epidemiology of canine adenovirus type 1 and type 2 in free-ranging red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in Italy,A. Balboni;R. Verin;F. Morandi;A. Poli;M. Battilani,Veterinary Microbiology,"To date, no studies exist regarding the presence of canine adenovirus (CAdV) infection in foxes in Italy. Furthermore, the majority of worldwide investigations regarding the presence of CAdV in foxes have been carried out using common serological assays which are unable to differentiate between CAdV type 1 and CAdV type 2. To assess the presence of viral infection in Italian red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), thirty-two subjects shot during the regular hunting season in the province of Pisa (Tuscany, Italy) were sampled and tested using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay capable of distinguishing between CAdV type 1 and type 2. Two subjects were positive for CAdV-1 infection and one other for CAdV-2 infection. Sequence analysis of the two CAdV-1 viruses showed complete identity between them and a high genetic similarity with all reference strains sequenced in dogs in the last twenty years, indicating the presence of genetically stable CAdV-1 in red foxes in Italy which could easily be transmitted from the wild animal population to domestic dogs. Therefore, this is the first reliable identification of CAdV-2 in foxes, and cloning of the virus detected has revealed a possible coinfection involving two different CAdV-2 strains, raising new questions about the pathogenic role of CAdV-2 in wildlife. The presence of CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 infection in foxes could represent a problem for both wild animals and domestic dogs, and emphasises the central role of red foxes in maintaining these viruses in the territory.To date, no studies exist regarding the presence of canine adenovirus (CAdV) infection in foxes in Italy.

332,Monitoring bluetongue disease (BTV-1) epidemic in southern Spain during 2007,A. Allepuz;I. García-Bocanegra;S. Napp;J. Casal;M. González,Preventive Veterinary Medicine,"On the 25th of July 2007, bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 1 was detected in Andalusia, southern Spain for the first time. A total of 4436 farms infected with BTV-1 were confirmed during that year: 3162 in sheep flocks, 113 in goat flocks, 7 in cattle herds and 1154 in mixed farms (sheep, goat and/or cattle in the same farm). The most common clinical signs were: fever, depression, lethargy, facial edema, and salivation (observed in more than 70% of the infected farms). Lesions in oral mucosa, lameness and dyspnea were also frequently observed.Median morbidity rate in sheep and goat flocks were 6.3% and 2.7% respectively. Median mortality rate was 2.2% in sheep flocks and 1.2% in goat flocks. Median case fatality rate was 29.8% in sheep flocks and 45% in goat flocks. Morbidity and mortality rates were not significantly higher in sheep flocks than in goat flocks (p &gt; 0.05), whereas case fatality rate was significant higher in goat flocks compared to sheep flocks (p &lt; 0.05). Neither clinical signs nor mortality were observed in cattle herds.The spatial distribution of the risk of BTV infection over Andalusia by municipality was evaluated by means of a hierarchical Bayesian model. The results evidenced that the risk was not homogeneous over the territory, being higher in the western part of the region. The likelihood of BTV infection was increased between 1.01 and 1.16 times by an increase of 10,000 domestic ruminants, and between 1.01 and 1.69 times by the presence of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in the municipality."
333,Monitoring volatile compounds during dry-cured ham ripening by solid-phase microextraction coupled to a new direct-extraction device,A. Andrés;R. Cava;J. Ruiz,Journal of Chromatography A,"Key flavour volatile compounds were monitored during ripening of dry-cured ham by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to a new direct-extraction device (DED). DED allows the insertion of the SPME fibre into the core of solid materials with no damage to the fibre. This enables extraction of volatiles from solid foodstuffs while avoiding sample handling. Major groups of volatile compounds extracted with SPME–DED agreed with available scientific literature about dry-cured ham volatiles. Moreover, volatile compounds previously highlighted as quality markers in dry-cured ham, such as 3-methylbutanal or hexanal, were satisfactorily extracted using SPME–DED. Changes in the profile of volatile compounds throughout the processing followed a typical pattern of volatile compounds formation. Therefore, SPME–DED appears as a new and promising method for monitoring ripening of dry-cured hams with no depreciation of the product, which might substitute traditional subjective methods currently used in the ham processing industry. However, the use of the internal standard method is not possible with this technique. Therefore, results using SPME–DED only point out a trend in the volatile profile. Further attempts relating data obtained using SPME–DED in dry-cured hams with sensory and chemical data from the same samples would be necessary for optimising this method as a quality control method in dry-cured ham industries.Key flavour volatile compounds were monitored during ripening of dry-cured ham by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to a new direct-extraction device (DED).

338,Multi-rater delta: extending the delta nominal measure of agreement between two raters to many raters,A. Andrés;M. Hernández,ArXiv Statistics,"The need to measure the degree of agreement among R raters who independently classify n subjects within K nominal categories is frequent in many scientific areas. The most popular measures are Cohen's kappa (R = 2), Fleiss' kappa, Conger's kappa and Hubert's kappa (R $\geq$ 2) coefficients, which have several defects. In 2004, the delta coefficient was defined for the case of R = 2, which did not have the defects of Cohen's kappa coefficient. This article extends the coefficient delta from R = 2 raters to R $\geq$ 2. The coefficient multi-rater delta has the same advantages as the coefficient delta with regard to the type kappa coefficients: i) it is intuitive and easy to interpret, because it refers to the proportion of replies that are concordant and non random; ii) the summands which give its value allow the degree of agreement in each category to be measured accurately, with no need to be collapsed; and iii) it is not affected by the marginal imbalance."

The results showed that the five-factor structure with 20 facets replicated well across cultures with a total congruence coefficient of .97. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) resulted in adequate fit indices for the five factors based on the comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker–Lewis index (TLI; >.90), and RMSEA (.031-.081). A series of CFA to assess measurement invariance across cultures resulted in adequate CFIs and TLIs for configural and metric invariance. However, factors did not show scalar invariance. Alpha internal consistencies of five factors ranged between .77 (Sensation Seeking) and .86 (Neuroticism). The average alpha of the 20 facets was .64 with a range from .43 (SS4) to .75 (AG1). Nevertheless, alpha reliabilities were lower in some facets and cultures, especially for Senegal and Togo. The average percentage of the variance explained based on the adjusted R2 was 2.9%, 1.7%, and 5.1% for age, sex, and, cultures, respectively. Finally, multidimensional scaling suggested that geographically or culturally close cultures share mean profile similarities."
340,Multiobjective Optimal Location of FACTS Shunt-Series Controllers for Power System Operation Planning,A. Ara;A. Kazemi;S. Niaki,IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery,"This paper develops appropriate models of flexible ac transmission systems (FACTS) shunt-series controllers for multiobjective optimization and also presents a multiobjective optimization methodology to find the optimal location of FACTS shunt-series controllers. The objective functions are the total fuel cost, power losses, and system loadability with and without minimum cost of FACTS installation. The ε-constraint approach is implemented for the multiobjective mathematical programming (MMP) formulation, including the FACTS shunt-series controllers (i.e., phase-shifting transformer (PST), hybrid flow controller (HFC), and unified power-flow controller (UPFC)). Simulation results are presented for the IEEE 14-bus system. The optimization method is numerically solved using Matlab and general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) software environments. The solution procedure uses nonlinear programming (NLP) and mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) to solve the optimal location and setting of FACTS incorporated in the optimal power-flow problem considering these objective functions and improving the power system operation. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the HFC is outperformed by PST and UPFC from the analytical and technical point of views."

Christofides;K. Asante;C. Schauer;W. Sharieff;S. Owusu‐Agyei;S. Zlotkin,Maternal & Child Nutrition,"Home‐fortification of complementary foods with micronutrients (including iron) as Sprinkles is a new strategy to control iron deficiency and anaemia in developing countries. However, the most effective dose and form of iron is not known. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of various doses (12.5, 20 or 30 mg) and treatment methods (multi‐micronutrient Sprinkles vs. ferrous sulphate drops) on haemoglobin (Hb) concentration after 8 weeks of treatment in anaemic children. In total, 133 anaemic Ghanaian children (Hb 70–99 g L−1) aged 6–18 months were randomly assigned to one of five daily interventions for 8 weeks. Out of the five interventions, four used Sprinkles, and one used iron drops. Of the four Sprinkles groups, three included 12.5, 20 or 30 mg of iron as ferrous fumarate, and one included 20 mg of iron as ferric pyrophosphate. The iron drops group included 12.5 mg of iron as liquid ferrous sulphate. Hb concentrations were measured at baseline, week 3 and week 8. The primary outcome measure was Hb concentration at 8 weeks after treatment. We compared differences in Hb and ferritin concentrations and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia (Hb < 100 g L−1 and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations >8.5 mg L−1) from baseline to 8 weeks within and between groups. Adherence and reporting of side effects (staining of the teeth, ease of use, diarrhoea and darkening of stools) were compared between groups. Mean change in Hb was 1.4 g L−1 (SD = 1.8) (P = 0.0001). Change in Hb concentrations from baseline to 8 weeks was significant in all groups (P = 0.0001–0.0007), with no differences across groups. Geometric means of serum ferritin varied from 18.6 to 44.0 µg L−1 at baseline. At week 8, these means were in the interval of 48.0–78.3 µg L−1, with no group differences. Prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia decreased significantly from baseline to 8 weeks in all groups with the exception of the iron drops group, with no group differences. Adherence was lower in the drops group (64%) as compared with Sprinkles groups (84%). Greater staining of the teeth and less ease of use were reported in the drops group as compared with Sprinkles groups. A dose as low as 12.5 mg of iron as ferrous fumarate when provided as Sprinkles may be effective in anaemic children."
344,Nanodynamics of Dendritic Core–Multishell Nanocarriers,A. Boreham;M. Pfaff;E. Fleige;R. Haag;U. Alexiev,Langmuir,"The molecular dynamics of polymeric nanocarriers is an important parameter for controlling the interaction of nanocarrier branches with cargo. Understanding the interplay of dendritic polymer dynamics, temperature, and cargo molecule interactions should provide valuable new insight for tailoring the dendritic architecture to specific needs in nanomedicine, drug, dye, and gene delivery. Here, we have investigated polyglycerol-based core–multishell (CMS) nanotransporters with incorporated Nile Red as a fluorescent drug mimetic and CMS nanotransporters with a covalently bound fluorophore (Indocarbocyanine) using fluorescence spectroscopy methods. From time-resolved fluorescence depolarization we have obtained the rotational diffusion dynamics of the incorporated dye, the nanocarrier, and its branches as a function of temperature. UV/vis and fluorescence lifetime measurements provided additional information on the local dye environment. Our results show a distribution of the cargo Nile Red within the nanotransporter shells that depends on solvent and temperature. In particular, we show that the flexibility of the polymer branches in the unimolecular state of the nanotransporter undergoes a temperature-dependent transition which correlates with a larger space for the mobility of the incorporated hydrophobic drug mimetic Nile Red and a higher probability of cargo–solvent interactions at temperatures above 31 °C. The measurements have further revealed that a loss of the cargo molecule Nile Red occurred neither upon dilution of the CMS nanotransporters nor upon heating. Thus, the unimolecular preloaded CMS nanotransporters retain their cargo and are capable to transport and respond to temperature, thereby fulfilling important requirements for biomedical applications."

Meredith,Nature Communications (Optics and Photonics),"Spectrally selective light detection is vital for full-colour and near-infrared (NIR) imaging and machine vision. This is not possible with traditional broadband-absorbing inorganic semiconductors without input filtering, and is yet to be achieved for narrowband absorbing organic semiconductors. We demonstrate the first sub-100 nm full-width-at-half-maximum visible-blind red and NIR photodetectors with state-of-the-art performance across critical response metrics. These devices are based on organic photodiodes with optically thick junctions. Paradoxically, we use broadband-absorbing organic semiconductors and utilize the electro-optical properties of the junction to create the narrowest NIR-band photoresponses yet demonstrated. In this context, these photodiodes outperform the encumbent technology (input filtered inorganic semiconductor diodes) and emerging technologies such as narrow absorber organic semiconductors or quantum nanocrystals. The design concept allows for response tuning and is generic for other spectral windows.

346,Natural Gas Decarbonization as Tool for Greenhouse Gases Emission Control,A. Abánades,Frontiers in Energy Research,"The reduction and control of carbon dioxide emissions of the energy system and other industrial processes using fossil resources is one of the main concerns of our society. Natural gas may contribute to reduce such emissions as it is the fossil with the highest H/C ratio. In addition, a deep reduction of emissions requires advanced technologies such as carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) or utilization (CCU), or direct fossil decarbonization. Some practical approaches integrated in the power-to-gas scheme to the application of natural gas decarbonization are presented. The introduction of this technology in hydrogen mobility seems to be viable, providing a carbon-free production on site without hydrogen or carbon dioxide transport and storage. The integration of direct decarbonization into combined cycle plants for centralized electricity production is justified for carbon penalties above 50 €/kg."
347,Natural catastrophe insurance: How should the government intervene?,A. Charpentier;B. Maux,Journal of Public Economics,"This paper develops a theoretical framework for analyzing the decision to provide or buy insurance against the risk of natural catastrophes. In contrast to conventional models of insurance, the insurer has a non-zero probability of insolvency which depends on the distribution of the risks, the premium rate, and the amount of capital in the company. When the insurer is insolvent, each loss reduces the indemnity available to the victims, thus generating negative pecuniary externalities. Our model shows that government-provided insurance will be more attractive in terms of expected utility, as it allows these negative pecuniary externalities to be spread equally among policyholders. However, when heterogeneous risks are introduced, a government program may be less attractive in safer areas, which could yield inefficiency if insurance ratings are not chosen appropriately."

350,New Acridine-Based Tridentate Ligand for Ruthenium(II): Coordination with a Twist,A. Awada;A. Moreno-Betancourt;C. Philouze;Y. Moreau;D. Jouvenot;F. Loiseau,Inorganic Chemistry,"A new tridentate ligand based on acridine has been synthetized. The central acridine heterocycle bears two pyridine coordinating units at positions 4 and 5. The terdentate 2,7-di-tert-butyl-4,5-di(pyridin-2-yl)acridine (dtdpa) was then coordinated to a ruthenium(II) cation. The corresponding homoleptic complex could only be obtained where both ligands coordinate to the ruthenium in a fac fashion. Thus, a heteroleptic compound (2) was constructed in combination with a terpyridine ligand in order to constrain the ligand to adopt a mer geometry. Such a coordination imposes a dramatic twist on the acridine heterocycle, resulting in an unexpected photophysical behavior. The electrochemical and photophysical properties of both complexes were studied, and the molecular structure of 2 was determined by X-ray diffraction. The two compounds absorb at low energy wavelengths, and a very weak luminescence is detected only for complex 2 in the near-infrared region."

Direct and quantitative one-pot synthesis of new 4-alkoxybenzal­dehydes 2 is realized from 1-bromoalkanes and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Addition of NaH2PO2·H2O to aldehydes 2 leads to the formation of the bis-adducts and also to the cleavage of the ether bond. New [α-hydroxy-(4-alkoxybenzyl)]phosphinic acids 3 are prepared by addition of aldehydes 2 to aqueous hypophosphorous acid.
352,New Heroines for New Causes: how provincial women promoted a revisionist history through post-suffrage pageants,A. Binns,Women's History Review,"The selection and promotion of powerful role models was a major source of inspiration during the suffrage movement, with figures such as Joan of Arc invoked as justifying women’s rights. This research shows the tradition continued post-1914, but with a different focus. Well over a hundred amateur pageants of noble women were staged with a changing pantheon reflecting women’s new roles and aspirations. These events were staged by both religious and secular groups throughout Britain, but were most common in the small industrial towns of the Pennines, the South West and North East where Nonconformity was strong. The pageants varied from a couple of dozen performers to 1000, with newspapers frequently praising their elaborate costumes and historical accuracy. Though certain formats and characters appeared regularly, narrative choices often reflected the organisers’ tastes, sometimes introducing local heroines or reclaiming the Bible as a source of inspiration for powerful women."

354,Newmark sliding block model for pile-reinforced slopes under earthquake loading,A. Al-Defae;J. Knappett,Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering,"Recent studies have demonstrated that the use of a discretely-spaced row of piles can be effective in reducing the deformations of slopes in earthquakes. In this paper, an approximate strain-dependant Newmark sliding-block procedure for pile-reinforced slopes has been developed, for use in analysis and design of the piling scheme, and the model is validated against centrifuge test data. The interaction of the pile within the slipping soil was idealised using a non-linear elasto-plastic (P–y) model, while the interaction within the underlying stable soil was modelled using an elastic response model in which (degraded) soil stiffness is selected for an appropriate amount of shear strain. This combined soil–pile interaction model was incorporated into the improved Newmark methodology for unreinforced slopes presented by Al-defae et al. [1], so that the final method additionally incorporates strain-dependent geometric hardening (slope re-grading). When combined with the strain-dependent pile resistance, the method is therefore applicable to analysis of both the mainshock and subsequent aftershocks acting on the deformed slope. It was observed that the single pile resistance is mobilised rapidly at the start of a strong earthquake and that this and the permanent slope deformation are therefore strongly influenced by pile stiffness properties, pile spacing and the depth of the slip surface. The model shows good agreement with the centrifuge test data in terms of the prediction of permanent deformation at the crest of the slope (important in design for selecting an appropriate pile layout/spacing i.e. S/B) and in terms of the maximum permanent bending moments induced in the piles (important for appropriate structural detailing of the piles), so long as the slip surface depth can be accurately predicted.

355,"Nicht einfach nur End-zu-Seit, sondern auch T‑ oder Y‑Grafts",A. Böning,Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,"In der Koronarchirurgie spielt die „chirurgische Begabung“ eine sehr wichtige Rolle: Von einem „guten Operateur“ werden Fähigkeiten, wie eine ausgezeichnete Augen-Hand-Koordination, sowie weitere persönliche Qualifikationen erwartet. Vor diesem Hintergrund müssen sowohl der Assistenzarzt in der Weiterbildung, der Trainer und auch der Patient sorgfältig selektiert werden, um den werdenden Facharzt an die komplexen Koronaranastomosen heranzuführen. Für die Weiterbildung eines herzchirurgischen Assistenten ist es wichtig, dass bestimmte Regeln beim Anlegen einer Anastomose eingehalten werden. Diese Regeln werden in dieser Arbeit genauer beschrieben. Eine Überwachung des Graft-Flusses sowohl durch einfache Beobachtung als auch durch Dopplerflussmessung ist notwendig. Koronare Bypass-Chirurgie wird heutzutage meist bei Dreigefäßerkrankungen durchgeführt. Hier ist eine mikrochirurgische Technik bei der Ausführung einer komplett-arteriellen Revaskularisation, die möglicherweise einen Überlebensvorteil für Patienten bietet, wichtig. Ein gesicherter Überlebensvorteil besteht bei kompletter Koronarrevaskularisation im Vergleich zur inkompletten Revaskularisation, daher ist auf die ausreichende Anastomosenzahl zu achten. Die beschriebene mikrochirurgische Technik kann in der Weiterbildung erlernt werden; dazu ist ein strukturiertes Vorgehen bei der Weiterbildung wichtig. Eine Weiterbildungsoperation gefährdet nicht die Patientensicherheit. Surgical talent plays a very important role in coronary artery surgery: abilities, such as excellent eye-hand coordination as well as other personal abilities are expected from a “good surgeon”. Against this background, the junior physician in training, the trainer and the patient have to be meticulously selected in order to familiarize future cardiac surgeons with complex coronary anastomoses. For the advanced training of assistant cardiac surgeons it is important that certain rules are followed when creating an anastomosis. These rules are described in detail in this article. Monitoring of the graft flow by simple observation as well as by means of Doppler flow measurement is necessary. Coronary bypass surgery is nowadays carried out mostly in patients with three-vessel disease. A microsurgical technique is important for performing a complete arterial revascularization, which possibly has a survival advantage for the patient. A proven survival advantage exists for complete coronary revascularization in comparison to incomplete revascularization, therefore attention has to be paid not only to the quality but also to a sufficíent number of anastomoses. The microsurgical technique described can be learned during residency, for which a structured residential procedure in the training is a prerequisite. Coronary artery bypass grafting during training does not jeopardize patient safety."

Bij;R. Geskus;H. Fennema;K. Adams;R. Coutinho;N. Dukers,Sexually Transmitted Diseases,"Objectives: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are on the rise, mainly among men having sex with men (MSM). Goal: The goal of this study was to evaluate whether STD increases as seen in MSM are also visible among heterosexuals. Study Design: Attendees of the STD clinic in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, are routinely tested for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Additionally, all women are tested for trichomoniasis. STD time trends of heterosexual attendees between 1994 and 2005 were analyzed by logistic regression and generalized linear models with a negative binomial distribution. Results: The number of consultations doubled since 1994. However, no long-term increase was seen in the number of syphilis and gonorrhea infections. Additionally, the trichomonas prevalence declined. However, the number of chlamydia infections increased over time. Conclusions: Although the number of attendees increased, no evidence for increasing STD incidence was found among heterosexuals. The increase in chlamydia infections can probably be explained by increased screening resulting from increased numbers of attendees."

Chinnery;E. Eichler;P. Chance;M. Hannibal,Journal of Medical Genetics,"Background Genomic copy number variants have been shown to be responsible for multiple genetic diseases. Recently, a duplication in septin 9 (SEPT9) was shown to be causal for hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA), an episodic peripheral neuropathy with autosomal dominant inheritance. This duplication was identified in 12 pedigrees that all shared a common founder haplotype.Methods and results Based on array comparative genomic hybridisation, we identified six additional heterogeneous tandem SEPT9 duplications in patients with HNA that did not possess the founder haplotype. Five of these novel duplications are intragenic and result in larger transcript and protein products, as demonstrated through reverse transcription-PCR and western blotting. One duplication spans the entire SEPT9 gene and does not generate aberrant transcripts and proteins. The breakpoints of all the duplications are unique and contain regions of microhomology ranging from 2 to 9 bp in size. The duplicated regions contain a conserved 645 bp exon within SEPT9 in which HNA-linked missense mutations have been previously identified, suggesting that the region encoded by this exon is important to the pathogenesis of HNA.Conclusions Together with the previously identified founder duplication, a total of seven heterogeneous SEPT9 duplications have been identified in this study as a causative factor of HNA. These duplications account for one third of the patients in our cohort, suggesting that duplications of various sizes within the SEPT9 gene are a common cause of HNA."

Several failure cases have been reported in which longitudinal cracks are observed during installation and compaction processes. Because, in the current specifications, compacting forces are not considered as design parameters, this study aims at determining the effect of dynamic compaction forces on RC pipes of different sizes. Thus, complete nonlinear three-dimensional finite-element models of pipe and soil are developed and verified against full-scale experimental testing. Particularly, crack initiation and propagation are modeled and predicted. Finally, the effects of dynamic forces are identified on the RC pipe."

361,"Nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial transcript abundance along a maize leaf developmental gradient",A. Cahoon;E. Takacs;R. Sharpe;D. Stern,Plant Molecular Biology,"In maize, the chloroplast chromosome encodes 104 genes whose roles are primarily in photosynthesis and gene expression. The 2,000–3,000 nuclear gene products that localize to plastids are required both to encode and regulate plastid gene expression as well as to underpin each aspect of plastid physiology and development. We used a new “three-genome” maize biogenesis cDNA microarray to track abundance changes in nuclear, chloroplast and mitochondrial transcripts in stage 2 semi-emerged leaf blades of one month-old maize plants. We report the detection and quantification of 433 nuclear, 62 chloroplast, and 27 mitochondrial transcripts, with the majority of the nuclear transcripts predicted or known to encode plastid proteins. The data were analyzed as ratios of expression of individual transcripts in the green tip (mature chloroplasts) versus the yellow base of the leaf (etioplasts). According to the microarray data at least 51 plastid genes and 121 nuclear genes are expressed at least two-fold higher in the tip of the leaf. Almost all (25) mitochondrial and 177 nuclear transcripts were expressed at least 2–fold higher in the leaf base. Independent quantification of a subset of each transcript population by RNA gel blot analysis and/or quantitative real time RT-PCR concurred with the transcript ratios determined by the array. Ontological distribution of the transcripts suggests that photosynthesis-related RNAs were most highly abundant in the leaf tip and that energy use genes were most highly expressed in the base. Transcripts whose products are used in plastid translation constituted the largest single ontological group with relatively equal numbers of genes in the three expression categories, defined as higher in tip, higher in base, or equally expressed in tip and base."

363,Observations of the Icy Universe,A. Boogert;P. Gerakines;D. Whittet,Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics,"Freeze-out of the gas-phase elements onto cold grains in dense interstellar and circumstellar media builds up ice mantles consisting of molecules that are mostly formed in situ (H 2 O, NH 3 , CO 2 , CO, CH 3 OH, and more). This review summarizes the detected infrared spectroscopic ice features and compares the abundances across Galactic, extragalactic, and Solar System environments. A tremendous amount of information is contained in the ice band profiles. Laboratory experiments play a critical role in the analysis of the observations. Strong evidence is found for distinct ice formation stages, separated by CO freeze-out at high densities. The ice bands have proven to be excellent probes of the thermal history of their environment. The evidence for the long-held idea that processing of ices by energetic photons and cosmic rays produces complex molecules is weak. Recent state-of-the-art observations show promise for much progress in this area with planned infrared facilities."

To shed light on the probable role of the iron compounds in the formation of such deposits, magnetite (Fe3O4), one of the intrinsic components of the iron oxide multilayer scale of any carbon steel surface, was contacted with crude oil at 170 °C, a temperature similar to that of the bottom well, and subsequently aged at room temperature. Characterization of the samples was made by using XRD, Mössbauer, IR, TGA, EDS, and microscopic (SEM and TEM) techniques. Small amounts of new iron phases, magnetic (oxidized magnetite) and nonmagnetic (iron oxyhydroxides), an increase in the content of CC and C−O bonds of the organic phase, and an increase of the thermal stability of the organic phase indicated the formation of iron complexes of Fe ions and FeOOH with the oxygen functionalities."
365,On the FE modeling of soil–blade interaction in tillage operations,A. Armin;R. Fotouhi;W. Szyszkowski,Finite Elements in Analysis and Design,"In this manuscript a finite element (FE) investigation of soil–blade interaction is presented. The soil is considered as an elastic–plastic material with the non-associated Drucker–Prager constitutive law. A separation procedure to model the cutting of soil and a method of calculating the forces acting on the blade are proposed and discussed in detail.

Renault,Tunnelling and Underground Space Technology,"Radial joints are defined as the contact part between precast segments in each ring of mechanical excavated tunnel lining. The behavior of flat radial joints without connectors is investigated in this paper through full-scale experimental tests on fiber reinforced concrete elements without any traditional reinforcement. The tests were performed by imposing a joint opening, as typical can occur when higher level of ovalization in the lining are required. The results showed the effect of concrete crushing as well as the bursting phenomena.

367,On the capabilities and limitations of harmony search for parameter estimation in vapor–liquid equilibrium modeling,A. Bonilla-Petriciolet,Fluid Phase Equilibria,"The modeling of vapor–liquid equilibrium data using local composition models is an interesting and challenging global optimization problem in the context of chemical engineering and applied thermodynamics. Until now, several deterministic and stochastic global optimization strategies have been used for modeling vapor–liquid equilibrium (VLE) data. Stochastic optimization methods may offer several advantages for solving global optimization problems and, until now, some meta-heuristics have been tested for modeling phase equilibrium data. However, these optimization strategies usually show a robust performance but, in some challenging problems, they may fail to locate the global optimum. In particular, Harmony Search (HS) is a direct-search method with attractive characteristics for its use in phase equilibrium modeling and calculations. However, to the best of our knowledge, this stochastic optimization strategy has not been used to perform this type of thermodynamic calculations. This study introduces the HS method for solving the non-linear parameter estimation problem involved in the modeling of VLE data. Specifically, the performance of this meta-heuristic has been tested and analyzed using several sets of binary VLE data with local composition models and both the classical approach of the least squares regression and the error-in-variable formulation. Results of this study are used to identify the capabilities and limitations of HS for VLE data modeling. In summary, HS is a promising meta-heuristic for processing these phase equilibrium data using the classical least square formulation and may offer a better performance than those obtained using current stochastic methods such as Genetic Algorithm or Particle Swarm Optimization. However, the reliability of the traditional HS is poor for VLE parameter estimation using the error-in-variable formulation. Finally, this paper discusses and analyzes alternatives to improve the performance of HS in VLE data modeling especially for the error-in-variable approach. Results indicate that the HS variants called the Improved Harmony Search and the Global-Best Harmony Search offer a better performance for solving EIV parameter estimation problems.The modeling of vapor–liquid equilibrium data using local composition models is an interesting and challenging global optimization problem in the context of chemical engineering and applied thermodynamics.

368,On the concept of earthquake resistant hybrid steel frames,A. Abolmaali;M. Razavi;D. Radulova,Journal of Constructional Steel Research,"The concept of hybrid steel frame system is presented in which mixtures of fully-rigid and semi-rigid steel connections are used in the 9 and 20-story SAC frames. Several different patterns and locations of semi-rigid connection replacements within the frame are examined in order to identify the hybrid frames with most energy dissipation capabilities. Inelastic dynamic analyses are conducted on the proposed selected frames by subjecting them to the Los Angeles earthquake records characterized as those with 10% probabilities of exceedance in 50 years and 2% probabilities of exceedance in 50 years. The maximum story drift for the hybrid frames are determined and compared to the “life safety” and “collapse prevention” limits as recommended by the FEMA 356. The roof-displacement time history, story drift, and member forces for the hybrid frames are reported and compared with those of conventional SAC frames without semi-rigid connections."
369,On the interaction between differential rotation and magnetic fields in the Sun,A. Brun,Solar Physics,"We have performed 3-D numerical simulations of compressible convection under the influence of rotation and magnetic fields in spherical shells. They aim at understanding the subtle coupling between convection, rotation and magnetic fields in the solar convection zone. We show that as the magnetic Reynolds number is increased in the simulations, the magnetic energy saturates via nonlinear dynamo action, to a value smaller but comparable to the kinetic energy contained in the shell, leading to increasingly strong Maxwell stresses that tend to weaken the differential rotation driven by the convection. These simulations also indicate that the mean toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields are small compared to their fluctuating counterparts, most of the magnetic energy being contained in the non-axisymmetric fields. The intermittent nature of the magnetic fields generated by such a turbulent convective dynamo confirms that in the Sun the large-scale ordered dynamo responsible for the 22-year cycle of activity can hardly be located in the solar convective envelope."
370,On the pH and concentration response of an evanescent field absorption sensor using a coiled-shape plastic optical fiber,A. Armin;M. Soltanolkotabi;P. Feizollah,Sensors and Actuators A: Physical,"Evanescent field absorption coefficient has been measured in a coiled-shape plastic optical fiber sensor in presence of methylene-blue dye. This measurement shows that the evanescent field absorption coefficient is a nonlinear function of the dye concentration. The nonlinearity might be due to adsorption or accumulation of dye molecules on the core surface of the fiber. Dependence of the evanescent field absorption coefficient on pH level has also been investigated, which indicates non-linearity increases for higher pH levels."
371,On the return period of the 2003 heat wave,A. Charpentier,Climatic Change,"Extremal events are difficult to model since it is difficult to characterize formally those events. The 2003 heat wave in Europe was not characterized by very high temperatures, but mainly the fact that night temperature were no cool enough for a long period of time. Hence, simulation of several models (either with heavy tailed noise or long range dependence) yield different estimations for the return period of that extremal event."
372,On the validity condition of the chi-squared test in 2×2 tables,A. Andrés;M. Quevedo;J. García;A. Silva-Mato,Test,"A 2×2 contingency table is usually analyzed by using the chi-squared asymptotic test, with Yates' continuity correction (c=n/2, wheren is the total size of sample). This correction is the correct one when the chi-squared test is an approximation to Fisher's exact (conditional) test. When the chi-squared test is used as an approximation to Barnard's exact (unconditional) test for comparing two independent proportions (two samples of sizen 1 andn 2) or for contrasting independence (one sample with a size ofn), the correctionc is different (c=1 ifn 1≠n 2 orc=2 ifn 1=n 2 in the first case;c=0.5 in the second). Whatever the case, it is traditional to affirm that the asymptotic test is valid whenE&gt;5, whereE is the minimum expected quantity. Today it is recognized that this condition is too general and may not be appropriate. In the case of Yates' correction. Martín Andrés and Herranz Tejedor (2000) proved that the validity condition must be of the typeE&gt;E * —whereE * is a known function depending on the marginals of the table—and that checking the validity of the asymptotic test is equivalent to checking the asymmetry of the base statistic (a hypergeometric random variable). In the present article the authors prove that this argument is valid for the other two continuity corrections, and moreover, that the valueE * is obtained for all three cases. Given that the functionE * reaches an absolute maximum, it can be affirmed that the three chisquared tests referred to are valid whenE&lt;19.2, 14.9 or 6.2 (orE&gt;8.1, 7.7 or 3.9 ifn≤500) respectively for the three previous models (although for the first model and the two-tailed testE&gt;0 is sufficient)."
373,On-line Remote EKG as a Web Service,A. Ciuffoletti,ArXiv Computer Science,"A 3-leads, non-diagnostic EKG has a role in emergency rescue and homecare. In this paper we introduce the design and a prototype of a service, provided to a doctor and a patient, for the on-line remote visualization of patient's 3-leads EKG. The architecture is based on the HTTP protocol, using commercial off-the-shelf devices to implement the sensor on patient's side, a browser on a laptop PC on the doctor's side as viewer, and a cloud container to connect the two using Websockets. A prototype is built to evaluate signal latency, power consumption of the patient side device, and the quality of the rendering. After some experiments, latency is measured below $1sec$, and power consumption is estimated in the 2A*3.3V range; visualization is comparable to commercial, non-diagnostic products. The prototype patient device is portable, and can be operated using rechargeable battery packs. Its cost is below 100\$, and all the required equipment is commercially available. The architecture is ready for on field evaluation, and we indicate how to improve power consumption while reducing cost."

We will focus also on the fabrication aspects of these structures."
375,Optical wafer metrology sensors for process-robust CD and overlay control in semiconductor device manufacturing,A. Boef,Surface Topography: Metrology and Properties,"This paper presents three optical wafer metrology sensors that are used in lithography for robustly measuring the shape and position of wafers and device patterns on these wafers. The first two sensors are a level sensor and an alignment sensor that measure, respectively, a wafer height map and a wafer position before a new pattern is printed on the wafer. The third sensor is an optical scatterometer that measures critical dimension-variations and overlay after the resist has been exposed and developed. These sensors have different optical concepts but they share the same challenge that sub-nm precision is required at high throughput on a large variety of processed wafers and in the presence of unknown wafer processing variations. It is the purpose of this paper to explain these challenges in more detail and give an overview of the various solutions that have been introduced over the years to come to process-robust optical wafer metrology."
376,Optimal regulation of renewable energy: A comparison of Feed-in Tariffs and Tradable Green Certificates in the Spanish electricity system,A. Ciarreta;M. Espinosa;C. Pizarro-Irizar,Energy Economics,"Incentives for renewable energy based on Feed-in-Tariffs have succeeded in achieving high levels of renewable installed capacity. However, these incentives have not been responsive to market conditions or price signals, imposing in some cases a great financial burden on consumers when Renewable Energy Sources reached significant levels. A way out of this problem could be a market mechanism where incentives respond to the level of investment on renewables. We explore this issue comparing a regulatory system based on Tradable Green Certificates, able to react to market changes, to a Feed-in-Tariffs incentive scheme. We model the strategic interaction between participants in the electricity pool and the Tradable Green Certificates market and focus on the optimal regulation for the retailer segment, which generates the desired demand for green certificates as a decreasing function of the certificate price. We then calibrate our theoretical model with data from the Spanish electricity system for the period 2008–2013. Simulations show that a green certificate scheme could both achieve the 2020 targets for renewable electricity and reduce regulatory costs. However, the role of regulators is still important, since setting the right target for renewable electricity affects the cost burden of the system."
377,Optimal transport on large networks a practitioner guide,A. Charpentier;A. Galichon;L. Vernet,ArXiv Quantitative Finance,"This article presents a set of tools for the modeling of a spatial allocation problem in a large geographic market and gives examples of applications. In our settings, the market is described by a network that maps the cost of travel between each pair of adjacent locations. Two types of agents are located at the nodes of this network. The buyers choose the most competitive sellers depending on their prices and the cost to reach them. Their utility is assumed additive in both these quantities. Each seller, taking as given other sellers prices, sets her own price to have a demand equal to the one we observed. We give a linear programming formulation for the equilibrium conditions. After formally introducing our model we apply it on two examples: prices offered by petrol stations and quality of services provided by maternity wards. These examples illustrate the applicability of our model to aggregate demand, rank prices and estimate cost structure over the network. We insist on the possibility of applications to large scale data sets using modern linear programming solvers such as Gurobi. In addition to this paper we released a R toolbox to implement our results and an online tutorial (http://optimalnetwork.github.io)"
378,Optimization of GFRP reinforcement in precast segments for metro tunnel lining,A. Caratelli;A. Meda;Z. Rinaldi;S. Spagnuolo;G. Maddaluno,Composite Structures,"The possibility of replacing the traditional steel reinforcement with glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) cages in precast concrete tunnel segmental lining has been shown by the authors in previous papers. The use of GFRP rebars as structural reinforcement in precast tunnel segments, allows several advantages in terms of structural durability or in cases of temporary lining that will have to be demolished later. Furthermore, this reinforcement type can be a suitable solution to create dielectric joints, ensuring the interruption of possible stray currents, which often lead to corrosion problems. Nevertheless, this peculiar application requires curvilinear shape of the reinforcement, and then different production process and rebar geometries. In the present work, a suggestion for the optimization of the GFRP reinforcement for tunnel segment is given. Four different GFRP cage typologies are analysed and applied as a reinforcement in full-scale tunnel segments. Both bending and point load tests are developed and the structural performances of the specimens are compared and discussed. Finally, the best solution, in terms of cost-benefit analysis is proposed."
379,Optimizing the Radio Network Parameters of the Long Term Evolution System Using Taguchi's Method,A. Awada;B. Wegmann;I. Viering;A. Klein,IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology,"One of the primary aims of radio network planning is to configure the parameters of the base stations such that the deployment achieves the required quality of service. However, the adjustment of radio network parameters in a heterogeneous macro-only cellular network is a complex task, which involves a large number of configuration parameters with interactions among them. Existing commercial planning tools are based on local search methods, e.g., simulated annealing, that require problem-specific and heuristic definitions of the input parameters. The problem with local search methods is that their performance can significantly be degraded if the input parameters are misconfigured. To overcome these difficulties, an iterative optimization procedure based on Taguchi's method is proposed to find near-optimal settings. Taguchi's method was originally applied in manufacturing processes and has recently been used in several engineering fields. Unlike local search methods that heuristically discover the multidimensional parameter space of candidate solutions, Taguchi's method offers a scientifically disciplined methodology to explore the search space and select near-optimal values for the parameters. In this paper, the application of Taguchi's method in radio network optimization is illustrated by setting typical radio network parameters of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) system, i.e., the uplink power control parameters, antenna tilts, and azimuth orientations of trisectored macro base stations. Simulation results reveal that Taguchi's method is a promising approach for radio network optimization with respect to performance and computational complexity. It is shown that Taguchi's method has a comparable performance to simulated annealing in terms of power control and antenna azimuth optimizations; however, it performs better in terms of antenna tilt optimization. Moreover, it is presented that the performance of simulated annealing, as opposed to Taguchi's method, highly depends on the definition of the input parameters."
380,PROBOSCIDEAN RESOURCES AND THE ENGINEERING OF ACHEULEAN LITHIC TECHNOLOGY,A. Cannell,Lithic Technology,"A proposed model of Structured Placement of bifaces is presented as the use of tools designed to randomly wound an animal that can later be tracked and processed. The targeting of the cushioned feet of proboscideans is examined and the design of these tools is discussed from the point of view of size, shape, material, geological setting (grounding) and scale of production. A tool that fits these engineering specifications is the Achuelean biface and the archaeological record is examined to test this hypothesis. It is noted that there is a close parallel, both geographical and in time-line, between the spread of Acheulean lithic technology, the dispersal of the Paleoloxodon faunal assemblage and elephas butchery sites. The model is shown to lead to a behavior of structured placement that is reflected in the archaeological record in terms of abundance, apparent discard, geological setting and biface-rich and biface-poor strata and sites."
381,Parallel Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiplication and Indexing: Implementation and Experiments,A. Buluç;J. Gilbert,SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing,"Generalized sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (or SpGEMM) is a key primitive for many high performance graph algorithms as well as for some linear solvers, such as algebraic multigrid. Here we show that SpGEMM also yields efficient algorithms for general sparse-matrix indexing in distributed memory, provided that the underlying SpGEMM implementation is sufficiently flexible and scalable. We demonstrate that our parallel SpGEMM methods, which use two-dimensional block data distributions with serial hypersparse kernels, are indeed highly flexible, scalable, and memory-efficient in the general case. This algorithm is the first to yield increasing speedup on an unbounded number of processors; our experiments show scaling up to thousands of processors in a variety of test scenarios."
382,Pareto models for risk management,A. Charpentier;E. Flachaire,ArXiv Economics,"The Pareto model is very popular in risk management, since simple analytical formulas can be derived for financial downside risk measures (Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall) or reinsurance premiums and related quantities (Large Claim Index, Return Period). Nevertheless, in practice, distributions are (strictly) Pareto only in the tails, above (possible very) large threshold. Therefore, it could be interesting to take into account second order behavior to provide a better fit. In this article, we present how to go from a strict Pareto model to Pareto-type distributions. We discuss inference, and derive formulas for various measures and indices, and finally provide applications on insurance losses and financial risks."
383,Partial resistance to Wheat dwarf virus in winter wheat cultivars,A. Benkovics;G. Vida;D. Nelson;O. Veisz;I. Bedford;D. Silhavy;M. Boulton,Plant Pathology,"Four Hungarian winter wheat cultivars were investigated for their susceptibility to the geminivirus Wheat dwarf virus (WDV). Previously, two cultivars (Mv Regiment and Mv Emese) were assessed by breeders to exhibit virus symptoms in the field, whereas Mv Dalma and Mv Vekni showed few symptoms. Two inoculation techniques for WDV, vector transmission with the leafhopper Psammotettix alienus and agroinoculation, were used. Leafhopper transmission was more efficient than agroinoculation. However, irrespective of the technique used, no Mv Dalma or Mv Vekni plants showed clear WDV symptoms. In contrast, 3/30 Mv Emese and 4/36 Mv Regiment plants showed dwarfing and chlorosis after agroinoculation and 13/17 and 14/15 plants, respectively, had clear WDV symptoms after vector transmission. WDV‐specific PCR showed that Mv Vekni and Mv Dalma plants could be infected, especially following vector transmission (approximately 50% infection), but at significantly lower frequency than Mv Emese or Mv Regiment plants (100% infection). Furthermore, real‐time PCR showed that WDV DNA accumulated to much lower levels in infected Mv Vekni and Mv Dalma plants than in infected Mv Regiment and Mv Emese plants. The data strongly suggest that Mv Vekni and Mv Dalma are partially resistant to WDV infection. As WDV resistance has not previously been identified in wheat, and because WDV can cause significant yield losses, the resistance of Mv Vekni or Mv Dalma will provide a valuable breeding resource."

Nunn;J. Harrison;B. Gabbe,Annals of Surgery,"Objective: To characterize patterns of engagement in work during the 4-year period after major traumatic injury , and to identify factors associated with those patterns. Background: Employment is an important marker of functional recovery from injury . There are few population-based studies of long-term employment outcomes, and limited data on the patterns of return to work (RTW) after injury . Methods: A population-based, prospective cohort study using the Victorian State Trauma Registry. A total of 1086 working age individuals, in paid employment or full-time education before injury , were followed-up through telephone interview at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months post- injury . Responses to RTW questions were used to define 4 discrete patterns: early and sustained; delayed; failed; no RTW. Predictors of RTW patterns were assessed using multivariate multinomial logistic regression. Results: Slightly more than half of respondents (51.6%) recorded early sustained RTW. A further 15.5% had delayed and 13.3% failed RTW. One in 5 (19.7%) did not RTW. Compared with early sustained RTW, predictors of delayed and no RTW included being in a manual occupation and injury in a motor vehicle accident. Older age and receiving compensation predicted both failed and no RTW patterns. Preinjury disability was an additional predictor of failed RTW. Presence of comorbidity was an additional predictor of no RTW. Conclusions: A range of personal, occupational, injury , health, and compensation system factors influence RTW patterns after serious injury . Early identification of people at risk for delayed, failed, or no RTW is needed so that targeted interventions can be delivered."
385,Performance of Stochastic Global Optimization Methods in the Calculation of Phase Stability Analyses for Nonreactive and Reactive Mixtures,A. Bonilla-Petriciolet;R. Vázquez-Román;G. Iglesias-Silva;K. Hall,Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research,"In this paper, we perform a comparative study of four stochastic optimization methods for calculating the phase stability of reactive and nonreactive mixtures. We have compared the algorithms: simulated annealing, very fast simulated annealing, a modified version of direct search simulated annealing, and stochastic differential equations. We test the numerical performance and reliability of these methods using several stability problems. From our results, the simulated annealing algorithm appears to be the most reliable method for minimization of the tangent plane distance function for both reactive and nonreactive mixtures."

For the FFFS, 5 excitation wavelengths were investigated, while 6 offsets were studied for SFS.Globally, the results showed a good discrimination between muscles with Recall and Precision between 47.82 and 94.34% and Error ranging from 6.03 to 32.39%. For the FFFS, the PLS-SVM with the 382 nm excitation wavelength gave the best discrimination results (Recall, Precision and Error of 94.34%, 89.53% and 6.03% respectively).

Walker,Cardiovascular Toxicology,"In utero and lactational exposure of mice to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) leads to cardiac hypertrophy and hydronephrosis in adulthood. We tested the hypothesis that perinatal TCDD exposure increases the susceptibility to cardiovascular disease when offspring are exposed to a common cardiovascular disease risk factor, angiotensin II (Ang II). Pregnant C57BL/6N mice were exposed to corn oil (control) or 6.0 μg/kg TCDD on gestation day 14.5. Male offspring were then exposed to a subpressor (0.1 mg/kg/day) or pressor (0.7 mg/kg/day) dose of Ang II at 3.5 months and cardiac morphology and blood pressure analyzed, respectively. Perinatal TCDD exposure increased left ventricular cavity dilation during diastole, and wall thickness during diastole and systole. While Ang II stimulated an increase in wall thickness, the degree of increase was equivalent between control and TCDD offspring. In contrast, perinatal TCDD exposure did not alter basal blood pressure. However, Ang II increased systolic blood pressure more rapidly and to a greater degree in TCDD offspring. Further, Ang II stimulated renal myofibroblast differentiation and collagen deposition to a greater degree, and tended to increase procollagen I mRNA in TCDD offspring, compared to controls. These data suggest that perinatal TCDD exposure increases the susceptibility of offspring to renal fibrosis and hypertension in adulthood."
388,Personalized management of patients with solid cancers: moving from patient characteristics to tumor biology,A. Awada;A. Vandone;P. Aftimos,Current Opinion in Oncology,"Purpose of review: In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the diagnosis as well as the treatment of solid tumors. This review will detail some of the recent findings that led to better subtyping and treatment of cancers, some of which were historically refractory. Recent findings: Advances in molecular biology have recently led to the rapid development of personalized cancer management . Molecular markers and gene signatures allow better risk definition and treatment prediction, thus, avoiding ‘wasted toxicity’. Recent understandings in disease pathways are giving new hope to treatment of hard-to-treat cancers such as melanoma, subtypes of nonsmall cell lung cancer and several orphan tumors. Summary: This progress transposed from lab to bedside has made personalized cancer care a reality. In addition, this concept is being integrated into clinical trial designs with the enrolment of molecularly selected patients, hopefully leading to high rates of success"

Lebwohl;C. Wu;H. Burris,Cancer Chemotherapy and Pharmacology,"Purpose To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), safety and recommended Phase II dose of ixabepilone, administered weekly as an intravenous (IV) infusion to patients with solid tumors who have failed standard therapy. Method This was an open-label, single-arm, Phase I, dose-escalation study. Results The MTD of ixabepilone [30-min, weekly IV infusion on a 21-day schedule ( N = 33)] was established at 25 mg/m 2 . Grade 3 fatigue was the DLT in 2/4 patients treated at 30 mg/m 2 . Ixabepilone was well tolerated at the MTD. Myelosuppression was rare, with no Grade 3/4 neutropenia. Due to the potential for cumulative neurotoxicity, the protocol was amended to a 1-h infusion, weekly for 3 weeks with a 1-week break. No DLT occurred at starting doses of 15, 20 and 25 mg/m 2 on this modified schedule ( N = 51), although overall toxicity was less at 15 and 20 mg/m 2 than 25 mg/m 2 . Five patients (2 on the 30-min/21-day schedule and 3 on the 60-min/28-day schedule) achieved durable objective partial responses across a variety of tumor types. Conclusions Ixabepilone had an acceptable safety profile at the MTD of 25 mg/m 2 (as a 30-min weekly infusion on a continuous 21-day schedule) and at 20 mg/m 2 (as a 1-h weekly infusion on a modified 28-day schedule). The clinical activity and acceptable tolerability profile warrant further single- or combination-agent evaluation."

Mano;D. Valeriola;D. Strumberg;E. Brendel;C. Haase;B. Schwartz;M. Piccart,British Journal of Cancer,"BAY 43-9006 is a novel dual-action Raf kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor that targets tumour cell proliferation and tumour angiogenesis. This Phase I study was undertaken to determine the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), pharmacokinetics, and tumour response profile of oral BAY 43-9006 in patients with advanced, refractory solid tumours. BAY 43-9006 was administered daily for repeated cycles of 21 days on/7 days off. A total of 44 patients were enrolled at doses from 50 to 800 mg b.i.d. Pharmacokinetic profiles of BAY 43-9006 in plasma were determined during the first treatment cycle. The most frequently reported adverse events over multiple cycles were gastrointestinal (75%), dermatologic (71%), constitutional (68%), pain (64%), or hepatic (61%) related. A MTD of 400 mg b.i.d. BAY 43-9006 was defined. BAY 43-9006 was absorbed rapidly; steady-state conditions were reached within 7 days. BAY 43-9006 exposure increased nonproportionally with increasing dose. In all, 32 patients were evaluated for tumour response: 15 patients showed tumour progression, 16 patients experienced stable disease (>6 months in eight patients), and one patient with renal cell carcinoma achieved a partial response. BAY 43-9006 given for 21 days with 7 days off treatment was safe, well tolerated, and showed antitumour activity."

Bartholomeus;K. Forceville;T. Berghmans;M. Meeus;J. Cescutti;G. Munzert;K. Pilz;D. Liu;P. Schöffski,Investigational New Drugs,"Background This trial evaluated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, and activity of volasertib, a selective Polo-like kinase 1 inhibitor that induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis, combined with cisplatin or carboplatin in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors (NCT00969761; 1230.6). Methods Sequential patient cohorts (3 + 3 dose-escalation design) received a single infusion of volasertib (100–350 mg) with cisplatin (60–100 mg/m2) or carboplatin (area under the concentration versus time curve [AUC]4–AUC6) on day 1 every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. Sixty-one patients received volasertib/cisplatin (n = 30) or volasertib/carboplatin (n = 31) for a median of 3.5 (range, 1–6) and 2.0 (range, 1–6) treatment cycles, respectively. Results The most common cycle 1 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and fatigue. MTDs (based on cycle 1 DLTs) were determined to be volasertib 300 mg plus cisplatin 100 mg/m2 and volasertib 300 mg plus carboplatin AUC6. Co-administration did not affect the pharmacokinetics of each drug. Partial responses were observed in two patients in each arm. Stable disease was achieved in 11 and six patients treated with volasertib/cisplatin and volasertib/carboplatin, respectively. Conclusions Volasertib plus cisplatin or carboplatin at full single-agent doses was generally manageable and demonstrated activity in heavily pretreated patients with advanced solid tumors."
392,Phase diagram of a probabilistic cellular automaton with three-site interactions,A. Atman;R. Dickman;J. Moreira,Physical Review E,"We study a (1+1)-dimensional probabilistic cellular automaton that is closely related to the Domany-Kinzel stochastic-cellular automaton (DKCA), but in which the update of a given site depends on the state of three sites at the previous time step. Thus, compared with the DKCA, there is an additional parameter p3 representing the probability for a site to be active at time t, given that it and its nearest neighbors were active at time t−1. We study phase transitions and critical behavior for the activity and for damage spreading, using one- and two-site mean-field approximations, and simulations, for p3=0 and p3=1. We find evidence for a line of tricritical points in the (p1,p2,p3) parameter space, obtained using a mean-field approximation at pair level. To construct the phase diagram in simulations we employ the growth-exponent method in an interface representation. For p3=0, the phase diagram is similar to the DKCA, but the damage-spreading transition exhibits a reentrant phase. For p3=1, the growth-exponent method reproduces the two absorbing states, first- and second-order phase transitions, bicritical point, and damage-spreading transition recently identified by Bagnoli et al. [Phys. Rev. E 63, 046116 (2001)]."
393,"Phase diagrams of site-frustrated Heisenberg models on simple cubic, bcc, and fcc lattices",A. Beath;D. Ryan,Physical Review B,"We have determined the phase diagrams of the site-frustrated Heisenberg model in three dimensions over the entire concentration regime of competing ferromagnetic (F) and antiferromagnetic (A) sites for the three basic lattice types: simple cubic (sc), body-centered cubic (bcc) and face-centered cubic (fcc) using Monte Carlo methods. Long-range ferromagnetic (FM) or antiferromagnetic (AF) order is established at a finite temperature, second-order phase transition whenever F or A sites percolate. Since site percolation thresholds in three dimensions are less than 12, FM and AF order coexist over a wide composition regime. The only apparent effect of frustration is to cause the AF and FM order to occur perpendicular to one another. Strong evidence is found to suggest that all of the transitions remain in the Heisenberg universality class and that there exists a tetracritical point at x=12 where TC=TN."
394,Physical properties of a new Deep Eutectic Solvent based on lithium bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide and N-methylacetamide as superionic suitable electrolyte for lithium ion batteries and electric double layer capacitors,A. Boisset;J. Jacquemin;M. Anouti,Electrochimica Acta,"Herein we present a study on the physical/chemical properties of a new Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES) based on N-methylacetamide (MAc) and lithium bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide (LiTFSI). Due to its interesting properties, such as wide liquid-phase range from −60 °C to 280 °C, low vapor pressure, and high ionic conductivity up to 28.4 mS cm−1 at 150 °C and at xLiTFSI = 1/4, this solution can be practically used as electrolyte for electrochemical storage systems such as electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and/or lithium ion batteries (LiBs). Firstly, relationships between its transport properties (conductivity and viscosity) as a function of composition and temperature were discussed through Arrhenius’ Law and Vogel–Tamman–Fulcher (VTF) equations, as well as by using the Walden classification. From this investigation, it appears that this complex electrolyte possesses a number of excellent transport properties, like a superionic character for example. Based on which, we then evaluated its electrochemical performances as electrolyte for EDLCs and LiBs applications by using activated carbon (AC) and lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) electrodes, respectively. These results demonstrate that this electrolyte has a good compatibility with both electrodes (AC and LiFePO4) in each testing cell driven also by excellent electrochemical properties in specific capacitance, rate and cycling performances, indicating that the LiTFSI/MAc DES can be a promising electrolyte for EDLCs and LiBs applications especially for those requiring high safety and stability."
395,Physician's Preference-based Instrumental Variable Analysis: Is It Valid and Useful in a Moderate-sized Study?,A. Boef;J. Paassen;M. Arbous;A. Middelkoop;J. Vandenbroucke;S. Cessie;O. Dekkers,Epidemiology,"Background: Instrumental variable methods can potentially circumvent the unmeasured confounding inherent in observational data analyses. Methods: We investigated the validity and usefulness of physician’s preference instrumental variable analysis in the setting of a moderate-sized clinical study. Using routine care data from 476 elective cardiac surgery patients, we assessed the effect of preoperative corticosteroids on mechanical ventilation time and duration of intensive care and hospital stay, occurrence of infections, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and delirium. Results: Although results of the physician’s preference-based instrumental variable analysis corresponded in direction to results of a recent large randomized trial of the same therapy, the instrumental variable estimates showed much larger effects with very wide confidence intervals. Conclusion: The lesser statistical precision limits the usefulness of instrumental variable analysis in a study that might be of sufficient size for conventional analyses, even if a strong and plausible instrument is available."

Mooijaart;C. Muth;N. Rodondi;T. Rosemann;A. Russell;H. Schers;V. Virgini;M. Waal;A. Warner;J. Gussekloo;W. Elzen,Epidemiology,"Background: Physician’s prescribing preference is increasingly used as an instrumental variable in studies of therapeutic effects. However, differences in prescribing patterns among physicians may reflect differences in preferences or in case-mix. Furthermore, there is debate regarding the possible assumptions for point estimation using physician’s preference as an instrument. Methods: A survey was sent to general practitioners (GPs) in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Ireland, Switzerland, and Germany, asking whether they would prescribe levothyroxine to eight fictitious patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. We investigated (1) whether variation in physician’s preference was observable and to what extent it was explained by characteristics of GPs and their patient populations and (2) whether the data were compatible with deterministic and stochastic monotonicity assumptions. Results: Levothyroxine prescriptions varied substantially among the 526 responding GPs. Between-GP variance in levothyroxine prescriptions (logit scale) was 9.9 (95% confidence interval: 8.0, 12) in the initial mixed effects logistic model, 8.3 (6.7, 10) after adding a fixed effect for country and 8.2 (6.6, 10) after adding GP characteristics. The occurring prescription patterns falsified the deterministic monotonicity assumption. All cases in all countries were more likely to receive levothyroxine if a different case of the same GP received levothyroxine, which is compatible with the stochastic monotonicity assumption. The data were incompatible with this assumption for a different definition of the instrument. Conclusions: Our study supports the existence of physician’s preference as a determinant in treatment decisions. Deterministic monotonicity will generally not be plausible for physician’s preference as an instrument. Depending on the definition of the instrument, stochastic monotonicity may be plausible."

Stern,Trends in Plant Science,"Two extracellular transcriptional compartments, mitochondria and plastids, are active in plants, depending mainly on nucleus-encoded proteins for transcription. Several nuclear genes encoding RNA polymerases have been cloned from a variety of organisms and their subcellular localization studied in detail.

398,Political Contributions and Public Procurement: Evidence from Lithuania,A. Baltrunaite,Journal of the European Economic Association,"This paper studies whether firms trade political contributions for public procurement contracts. Combining data on Lithuanian government tenders, corporate donors, and firm characteristics, I examine how a ban on corporate contributions affects the awarding of procurement contracts to companies that donated in the past. Consistent with political favoritism, donors’ probability of winning falls by five percentage points as compared to that of nondonor firms after the ban. Evidence on bidding and victory margins suggests that corporate donors may receive auction-relevant information affecting procurement outcomes in their favor."
399,Polymeric-SiO2-PCMs for improving the thermal properties of gypsum applied in energy efficient buildings,A. Borreguero;A. Serrano;I. Garrido;J. Rodríguez;M. Carmona,Energy Conversion and Management,"A new thermoregulating material containing the commercial paraffin Rubitherm®RT27 stabilized by SiO2 with a polymeric shell from polystyrene–divinylbenzene (Polymeric-SiO2-PCMs) was incorporated into gypsum up to a 15 mass ratio respect to the initial hemihydrate in order to develop building materials with a high thermal energy store (TES) capacity. The effect of this material on the gypsum crystals and the main physical, thermal and mechanical properties were studied and compared to those caused by another three kinds of thermoregulating materials. Polymeric-SiO2-PCMs presented the lowest agglomeration and therefore, the best distribution into the gypsum pores. As expected, the thermoregulating effect of the PCM improved the thermal properties of the gypsum since, the higher the microcapsules content, the higher the equivalent heat capacity (cp) and the accumulated heat power (qacc). Considering a conversion of 100% of the accumulated heat into electricity savings, the addition of a 15% of microcapsules respect to the hemihydrate allowed to save 10.20 kW h/m3 and, consequently, reduced the CO2 emissions in a 1.26 kg of CO2 per operating cycle. Besides, the addition of the Polymeric-SiO2-PCMs reduces the gypsum density, but it is always higher than 600 kg/m3, as required by the European regulation EN 13279-2. The thermal conductivity (k) is also reduced by the microcapsules addition but for the case of a content of 15%. On the other hand, the porosity is barely affected just varying always less than a 3.5%. Finally, despite of the fact that the Polymeric-SiO2-PCMs addition reduces the mechanical properties, all the developed materials satisfied the mechanical European regulation EN 13279-2 which limits the minimum compression and flexural strengths of gypsum composites for building construction to 2 and 1 MPa, respectively.

401,Positive selection in MAOA gene is human exclusive: determination of the putative amino acid change selected in the human lineage,A. Andrés;M. Soldevila;A. Navarro;K. Kidd;B. Oliva;J. Bertranpetit,Human Genetics,"Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) is the X-linked gene responsible for deamination and subsequent degradation of several neurotransmitters and other amines. Among other activities, the gene has been shown to play a role in locomotion, circadian rhythm, and pain sensitivity and to have a critical influence on behavior and cognition. Previous studies have reported a non-neutral evolution of the gene attributable to positive selection in the human lineage. To determine whether this selection was human-exclusive or shared with other species, we performed a population genetic analysis of the pattern of nucleotide variation in non-human species, including bonobo, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. Footprints of positive selection were absent in all analyzed species, suggesting that positive selection has been recent and unique to humans. To determine which human-unique genetic changes could have been responsible for this differential evolution, the coding region of the gene was compared between human, chimpanzee, and gorilla. Only one human exclusive non-conservative change is present in the gene: Glu151Lys. This human substitution affects protein dimerization according to a three-dimensional structural model that predicts a non-negligible functional shift. This is the only candidate position at present to have been selected to fixation in humans during an episode of positive selection. Divergence analysis among species has shown that, even under positive selection in the human lineage, the MAOA gene did not experience accelerated evolution in any of the analyzed lineages, and that tools such as Ka/Ks would not have detected the selective history of the gene."
402,Possible evidence for a methane source in Enceladus' ocean,A. Bouquet;O. Mousis;J. Waite;S. Picaud,Geophysical Research Letters,"The internal ocean of Enceladus can be expected to present conditions favorable to the trapping of volatiles in clathrates. This process could influence the eventual composition of the ocean and therefore of the plumes emitted by the south polar region. Here we used a statistical thermodynamic model to assess which species detected in the plumes by the Cassini‐Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer experiment are trapped in clathrates. We treated Enceladus' internal ocean as a terrestrial subglacial lake with a mixture of dissolved volatiles indicated by plume gas measurements. We find that the conditions for clathrate formation are met in this ocean, except above 20 km or in hypothetical hot spots. The formation of multiple guest clathrates depletes methane below plume levels, suggesting that clathrates eventually dissociate (releasing methane) in the fissure that connects the ocean to the surface or that another mechanism (such as hydrothermal reactions) is compensating by adding methane into the ocean."
403,Postmitotic diversification of olfactory neuron types is mediated by differential activities of the HMG‐box transcription factor SOX‐2,A. Alqadah;Y. Hsieh;B. Vidal;C. Chang;O. Hobert;C. Chuang,EMBO Journal,"Diversification of neuron classes is essential for functions of the olfactory system, but the underlying mechanisms that generate individual olfactory neuron types are only beginning to be understood. Here we describe a role of the highly conserved HMG‐box transcription factor SOX‐2 in postmitotic specification and alternative differentiation of the Caenorhabditis elegans AWC and AWB olfactory neurons. We show that SOX‐2 partners with different transcription factors to diversify postmitotic olfactory cell types. SOX‐2 functions cooperatively with the OTX/OTD transcription factor CEH‐36 to specify an AWC “ground state,” and functions with the LIM homeodomain factor LIM‐4 to suppress this ground state and drive an AWB identity instead. Our findings provide novel insights into combinatorial codes that drive terminal differentiation programs in the nervous system and reveal a biological function of the deeply conserved Sox2 protein that goes beyond its well‐known role in stem cell biology."

Laczkovics;M. Krieg,Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,"Erniedrigte Cholesterinspiegel sowie das Auftreten von Erythroblasten im peripheren Blut sind bekanntermaßen mit einer schlechten Prognose assoziiert. Während die pathophysiologischen Mechanismen (Postaggressionsstoffwechsel, Ernährungsprobleme, Heparinisierung, Leberversagen) eines erniedrigten Cholesterinspiegels bekannt sind, liegen für die Ursachen einer Erythroblastämie keine gesicherten Erkenntnisse vor. Bei Patienten nach herzchirurgischen Eingriffen sind diese Parameter in Bezug auf ihre prognostische Bedeutung bisher nicht untersucht worden.¶ In einer retrospektiven Fall-Kontroll-Studie analysierten wir die Daten von 2074 Patienten, von denen 87 (4,2%) postoperativ im Krankenhaus verstarben. Alle Patienten hatten sich herzchirurgischen Eingriffen mit Einsatz der Herz-Lungen-Maschine unterzogen. Zusammen mit Erythroblastenzahlen, Cholesterin- und Triglycerid-Serumspiegeln, Werten für C-reaktives Protein (CRP) und Alanin-Aminotransferase (ALT) wurden risikobezogene Faktoren wie Alter, Geschlecht, Body Mass Index, präoperative linksventrikuläre Funktion, Rauchen, Diabetes mellitus, Typ und Dringlichkeit der Operation, Niereninsuffizienz, pulmonale Hypertonie und Endokarditis ausgewertet. Die Statistik umfasste Sensitivität, Spezifität, prädiktiven Wert und Odds ratio.¶ Patienten, bei denen Erythroblasten (EBL) im peripheren Blut (n=57) nachgewiesen wurden, hatten mit 45,6% eine signifikant (p&lt;0,001) höhere Mortalität als Patienten ohne Erythroblastennachweis (3,0%). Keiner der Patienten mit mehr als 2000 EBL×106/L überlebte.¶ In der Gruppe der verstorbenen Patienten waren die Cholesterinwerte zwischen dem 4.–7. postoperativen Tag (95±6 mg/dL) signifikant (p&lt;0,001) niedriger als in der Gruppe der Überlebenden (169±1 mg/dL). Der positive prädiktive Wert eines Cholesterinspiegels &lt;120 mg/dl war 25,4%, eines Cholesterinspiegels &lt;60 mg/dL war 66,6%.¶ Sowohl der Nachweis von Erythroblasten im peripheren Blut als auch der Nachweis kritisch niedriger Cholesterinwerte hat bei Patienten nach herzchirurgischen Eingriffen eine hohe prognostische Bedeutung hinsichtlich der postoperativen Mortalität. In patients suffering from a variety of severe diseases, critically low cholesterol levels as well as the detection of erythroblasts (EBL) in peripheral blood is known to be associated with poor prognosis. While the pathophysiology of low cholesterol levels (post aggression metabolism, nutrition problems, heparin administration, liver failure) is quite well known, the causes of an erythroblastemia are still unclear. However, as yet the prognostic significance of low cholesterol levels and of EBL in blood of patients after cardiothoracic surgery has not been estimated.¶ In a retrospective case-control study, we analyzed a database of 2074 patients, of whom 87 died in the hospital during the postoperative period. All patients underwent cardiothoracic surgery using extracorporeal circulation. Together with serum levels of cholesterol, C-reactive protein (CRP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and triglycerides as well as EBL in blood, age, sex, body mass index, preoperative ejection fraction, smoking, diabetes mellitus, type of operation, emergency surgery, renal deficiency, pulmonary hypertension, and endocarditis were considered. The statistics included sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and odds ratio.¶ The postoperative mortality of patients with EBL in peripheral blood (n=57) was 45.6% (n=26), being significantly higher (P&lt;0.001) than the mortality of patients without EBL (3.0%). None of the 6 patients with more than 2000 EBL × 106/L survived.¶ In the deceased, the mean cholesterol level (±SEM) remained rather low between day 4 and 7 after surgery (95±6 mg/dL). In the survivors at that time the mean cholesterol level was significantly (P&lt;0.001) higher (169±1 mg/dL). The positive predictive value of a critically low cholesterol level (&lt;120 mg/dL) was 25.4%, increasing to 66.6% at a cut off level of 60 mg/dL.¶ Low cholesterol levels between days 4 and 7 and the detection of EBL in blood after cardio-thoracic surgery both possess a high prognostic significance in terms of in-hospital mortality."

Moran,Circulation,"Over 10 years, achieving and maintaining 2017 ACC/AHA guideline goals could prevent 3.0 million (UR, 1.1–5.1 million), 0.5 million (UR, 0.2–0.7 million), and 1.4 million (UR, 0.6–2.0 million) cardiovascular disease (CVD) events compared with maintaining current blood pressure (BP) levels, achieving 2003 Seventh Joint National Committee Report goals, and achieving 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee goals, respectively. We estimated the number of cardiovascular disease events prevented and treatment-related serious adverse events incurred over 10 years among US adults with hypertension by achieving 2017 ACC/AHA guideline-recommended BP goals compared with (1) current BP levels, (2) achieving 2003 Seventh Joint National Committee Report BP goals, and (3) achieving 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee panel member report BP goals.US adults aged ≥45 years with an indication for BP treatment were grouped according to recommendations for antihypertensive drug therapy in the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline, 2003 Seventh Joint National Committee Report, and 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee. Population sizes were estimated from the 2011 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Rates for fatal and nonfatal CVD events (stroke, coronary heart disease, or heart failure) were estimated from the REGARDS (REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke) study, weighted to the US population. CVD risk reductions with treatment to BP goals and risk for serious adverse events were obtained from meta-analyses of BP-lowering trials. CVD events prevented and treatment-related nonfatal serious adverse events over 10 years were calculated. Uncertainty surrounding main data inputs was expressed in uncertainty ranges (UR).Over ten years, achieving and maintaining 2017 ACC/AHA guideline goals compared with current BP levels, achieving 2003 Seventh Joint National Committee Report goals, or achieving 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee goals could prevent 3.0 million (UR, 1.1–5.1 million), 0.5 million (UR, 0.2–0.7 million), or 1.4 million (UR, 0.6–2.0 million) CVD events, respectively. Compared with current BP levels, achieving and maintaining 2017 goals could prevent 71.9 (UR, 26.6–122.3) CVD events per 1000 treated. Achieving 2017 guideline BP goals compared with current BP levels could also lead to nearly 3.3 million more serious adverse events over 10 years (UR, 2.2–4.4 million).Achieving and maintaining 2017 ACC/AHA BP goals could prevent a greater number of CVD events than achieving 2003 Seventh Joint National Committee Report or 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee BP goals but could also lead to more serious adverse events."
406,Potential Deaths Averted and Serious Adverse Events Incurred From Adoption of the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) Intensive Blood Pressure Regimen in the United States,A. Bress;H. Kramer;R. Khatib;S. Beddhu;A. Cheung;R. Hess;V. Bansal;G. Cao;J. Yee;A. Moran;R. Durazo-Arvizu;P. Muntner;R. Cooper,Circulation,"SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) demonstrated a 27% reduction in all-cause mortality with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of <120 versus <140 mm Hg among US adults at high cardiovascular disease risk but without diabetes mellitus, stroke, or heart failure. To quantify the potential benefits and risks of SPRINT intensive goal implementation, we estimated the deaths prevented and excess serious adverse events incurred if the SPRINT intensive SBP treatment goal were implemented in all eligible US adults.SPRINT eligibility criteria were applied to the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and linked with the National Death Index through December 2011. SPRINT eligibility included age ≥50 years, SBP of 130 to 180 mm Hg (depending on the number of antihypertensive medications being taken), and high cardiovascular disease risk. Exclusion criteria were diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, >1 g proteinuria, heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 mL·min−1·1.73 m−2, or dialysis. Annual mortality rates were calculated by dividing the Kaplan-Meier 5-year mortality by 5. Hazard ratios for all-cause mortality and heart failure and absolute risks for serious adverse events in SPRINT were used to estimate the number of potential deaths and heart failure cases prevented and serious adverse events incurred with intensive SBP treatment.The mean age was 68.6 years, and 83.2% and 7.4% were non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black, respectively. The annual mortality rate was 2.20% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.91–2.48), and intensive SBP treatment was projected to prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year (95% CI, 93 300–121 200) and give rise to 56 100 (95% CI, 50 800–61 400) episodes of hypotension, 34 400 (95% CI, 31 200–37 600) episodes of syncope, 43 400 (95% CI, 39 400–47 500) serious electrolyte disorders, and 88 700 (95% CI, 80 400–97 000) cases of acute kidney injury per year. The analysis-of-extremes approach indicated that the range of estimated lower- and upper-bound number of deaths prevented per year with intensive SBP control was 34 600 to 179 600. Intensive SBP control was projected to prevent 46 100 (95% CI, 41 800–50 400) cases of heart failure annually.If fully implemented in eligible US adults, intensive SBP treatment could prevent ≈107 500 deaths per year.

Vitaglione,Food Chemistry,"In this study, an artichoke stem powder (ASP) was used at three concentrations (3%, 6% and 9%) in the formulation of new breads. The bioaccessibility of polyphenols and cynaropicrin from the ASP-enriched breads was evaluated in vitro by using a digestion model combined to high resolution mass spectrometry analysis. The overall total antioxidant capacity of the bioaccessible and unsolubilized fractions obtained during the intestinal steps and the potential ability to modulate α-glucosidase activity were tested. Data showed that 82% of totally bioaccessible polyphenols and 74% of cynaropicrin were released during the duodenal digestion whereas 88% of caffeic acid was released in the colon step. The antioxidant capacity and the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the duodenal extract correlated with the amount of ASP in the bread. Data demonstrated that ASP might be a valuable functional ingredient to create a reducing environment in the intestine and to partially modulate glucose metabolism.Artichoke stem-enriched breads released antioxidants in the intestine upon digestion.82% of polyphenols and 74% of cynaropicrin were bioaccessible in duodenal step.88% of caffeic acid was solubilized during the colon step.The fraction released in the duodenal step partially inhibited α-glucosidase activity.The potential functionality of the breads correlated with the artichoke stem content.In this study, an artichoke stem powder (ASP) was used at three concentrations (3%, 6% and 9%) in the formulation of new breads.

408,Potential energy surfaces for ground and excited electronic states of the CF3I molecule and their relevance to its A-band photodissociation,A. Alekseyev;H. Liebermann;R. Buenker,Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,"The multireference spin–orbit (SO) configuration interaction (CI) method in its Λ-S contracted SO-CI version is employed to calculate two-dimensional potential energy surfaces for the ground and low-lying excited states of CF3I relevant to its photodissociation in the lowest absorption band (A band). The computed equilibrium geometry for the A1 ground state and vibrational frequency ν3 for the C–I stretch mode agree well with available experimental data. The 3Q0+ state dissociating to the excited I(2P1/2) limit is found to have a minimum of 1570 cm−1 significantly shifted to larger internuclear distances (RC–I = 5.3 a0) relative to the ground state. Similar to the CH3I case, this makes a single-exponent approximation commonly employed for analysis of the CF3I recoil dynamics unsuitable. The 4E(3A1) state possessing an allowed transition from the ground state and converging to the same atomic limit as 3Q0+ is calculated to lie too high in the Franck–Condon region to have any significant impact on the A-band absorption. The computed vertical excitation energies for the 3Q1, 3Q0+, and 1Q states indicate that the A-band spectrum must lie approximately between 31 300 and 45 200 cm−1, i.e., between 220 and 320 nm. This result is in very good agreement with the measured absorption spectrum."

Soyfoo,Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,"Objectives To investigate the role of the interleukin (IL)-33–ST2 axis in the pathophysiology of primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS).Methods Serum levels of IL-33 and sST2 were determined by ELISA. The expression of IL-33 and ST2 was investigated in salivary glands (SG) by immunohistochemistry. PBMC were isolated and stimulated with IL-33, IL-12 and IL-23 and the cytokine profile response was examined by flow cytometry. Intracellular cytokine detection of IFNγ and IL-17 was performed by flow cytometry.Results Serum IL-33 and sST2 levels were increased in pSS patients compared with controls and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Expression of IL-33 was upregulated in SG with Chisholm scores of 2 and 3 of pSS patients but comparable with controls for SG with Chisholm score of 4. ST2 expression in SG was downregulated in pSS patients. IL-33 at different concentrations did not increase the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines but acted synergistically with IL-12 and IL-23 to promote IFNγ production. NK and NKT cells were identified as main producers of IFNγ in vitro and were found in SG of pSS patients.Conclusions IL-33 is released in pSS, and acts with IL-12 and IL-23 to favour the secretion of IFNγ by NK and NKT cells."
410,Potential of fluorescence spectroscopy to predict fatty acid composition of beef,A. At-Kaddour;A. Thomas;J. Mardon;S. Jacquot;D. Gruffat,Meat Science,"The present study aimed to evaluate and compare the ability of front face (FFFS) and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) to predict total fat and FA composition of beef LT muscles coming from 36 animals of 3 breeds (Angus, Limousin and Blond d'Aquitaine). The regression models were performed by using Partial Least Square (PLS) method. In spite of the low number of samples used, the results of this preliminary study demonstrated the ability of fluorescence spectroscopy to predict meat lipids. Nonetheless, the results suggested that the fluorescence spectroscopy is more suited to measure SFA (R2p ≥ 0.66; RPD ≥ 2.29) and MUFA (R2p ≥ 0.48; RPD ≥ 1.49) than PUFA (R2p ≤ 0.48; RPD ≤ 1.63). Moreover, R2 and RPD factors obtained with FFFS were greater compared to the ones obtained with SFS suggesting that FFFS is more adapted to measure lipid composition of beef meat."
411,"Potential oligogenic disease of mental retardation, short stature, spastic paraparesis and osteopetrosis",A. Alsemari;M. Alsuhaibani;R. Alhathlool;B. Ali,Application of Clinical Genetics,"The interaction of multiple genetic factors, as opposed to monogenic inheritance, has been suspected to play a role in many diseases. This interaction has been described as an oligogenic inheritance model, which may be a useful tool in explaining certain clinical observations. The purpose of this study was to search for novel genetic defects among members of a family with traits that include mental retardation, short stature, osteopetrosis, calcification of basal ganglia, and thinning of the corpus callosum. In the index case (111-4), we identified four homozygous mutations: chromosome 8, intron2 (c.232+1G&gt;A) at CA2 gene; chromosome 15, exon 32 (c.6100C&gt;T) at the SPG11; chromosome 5, exon 11 (c.1015G&gt;A) at the MCCC2; and chromosome 9, exon 9 (C.1193g&gt;t) at the LARP gene. The mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and both parents were observed to be heterozygous for the four mutations. A moderately affected sister of the index case was homozygous for only three mutations in CA2, LARP, and Mccc2, while a nonaffected sister was heterozygous for three mutations in CA2, LARP, and MCCC2 and negative for SPG11. The clinical features of the two affected sisters can be explained distinctively by each homozygous mutation in an oligogenic pattern of inheritance. This family represents an example of an oligogenic pattern of inheritance of mental retardation, short stature, spastic paraparesis, and Keywords: mental retardation, short stature, spastic paraparesis, CA2, SPG11, LARP, oligogenic"
412,Power-dependent speciation of volatile organic compounds in aircraft exhaust,A. Beyersdorf;K. Thornhill;E. Winstead;L. Ziemba;B. Anderson,Atmospheric Environment,"As part of the third NASA Aircraft Particle Emissions Experiment (APEX-3, November 2005), whole air samples were collected to determine the emission rates of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from aircraft equipped with three different gas-turbine engines (an Allison Engine 3007-A1E, a Pratt–Whitney 4158, and a Rolls–Royce RB211-535E4B). Samples were collected 1 m behind the engine exhaust plane of the engines while they were operated at powers ranging from idle up to 30% of maximum rated thrust.Exhaust emission indices (mass emitted per kilogram of fuel used) for CO and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) were calculated based on enhancements over background relative to CO2. Emissions of all NMHCs were greatest at low power with values decreasing by an order of magnitude with increasing power. Previous studies have shown that scaling idle hydrocarbon emissions to formaldehyde or ethene (which are typically emitted at a ratio of 1-to-1 at idle) reduces variability amongst engine types. NMHC emissions were found to scale at low power, with alkenes contributing over 50% of measured NMHCs. However, as the power increases hydrocarbon emissions no longer scale to ethene, as the aromatics become the dominant species emitted. This may be due in part to a shift in combustion processes from thermal cracking (producing predominantly alkenes) to production of new molecules (producing proportionally more aromatics) as power increases. The formation of these aromatics is an intermediate step in the production of soot, which also increases with increasing power. The increase in aromatics relative to alkenes additionally results in a decrease in the hydroxyl radical reactivity and ozone formation potential of aircraft exhaust.Samples collected 30 m downwind of the engine were also analyzed for NMHCs and carbonyl compounds (acetone, 2-butanone and C1–C9 aldehydes). Formaldehyde was the predominant carbonyl emitted; however, the ratio of ethene-to-formaldehyde varied between the aircraft, possibly due to the sampling of transient emissions such as engine start-up and power changes. A large portion of the measured emissions (27–42% by mass) in the plume samples was made up of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) with oxygenated compounds being most significant."
413,Practice Makes Perfect: Meditation and the Exchange of Spiritual Capital,A. Arat,Journal of Contemporary Religion,"Despite its ubiquity, the term ‘spiritual capital’ continues to lack a sufficient level of empirical scrutiny to merit categorical independence from its religious variant. To remedy this gap, this article presents an ethnographic study of a meditation group called the Dhyana Centre, situated at the heart of London, and offers a bottom-up account of the ways in which spiritual capital is recognized, exchanged, and adopted in the absence of institutional mechanisms of legitimacy. Building on Bradford Verter’s conceptualisation of spiritual capital as originally derived from Bourdieu’s theory of practice, this study argues that the distinct configuration between knowledgeable and practical mastery in the dynamics of spiritual capital exchange marks a modus operandi which is not fully accounted for by conventional notions of religious capital. This study of spiritual capital thus allows for the translation of a notoriously slippery phenomenon into a much more tangible object of study without having to resort to essentialist readings of spirituality."
414,Practice Variations in Home Health Care,A. Brega;A. Jordan;R. Schlenker,Home Health Care Services Quarterly,"Wide variation in Medicare home care utilization became apparent in the 1990s. This study examined the impact of patient, provider, agency, and market factors on five measures of home care practice. Data were collected at 44 agencies in eight states. The final analysis sample included 732 home care episodes for which longitudinal patient data were available. Results indicated that patient factors, such as complexity and functional status, were important predictors of the care a patient received. Agency and market characteristics also strongly influenced care practices. Characteristics of the care providers, on the other hand, exerted only minimal influence."

416,Prediction of Driving after Stroke: A Prospective Study,A. Akinwuntan;H. Feys;W. Weerdt;G. Baten;P. Arno;C. Kiekens,Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair,"The process of determining whether patients with stroke should drive again often involves off-road evaluations and road tests that usually take about 2 to 3 h to complete. Objectives. This prospective study sought to identify the combination of tests that best predicts fitness to drive after stroke. The main aim was to develop a short and predictive predriving assessment battery. Methods. Sixty-eight consecutive stroke patients were studied who performed a mandatory predriving assessment at the Belgian Road Safety Institute, Brussels, within 18 months. Performance in a predriving assessment included medical examination (when needed), visual and neuropsychological evaluations, and an on-road test. Based on these assessments, a physician, psychologist, and the driving safety expert who administered the tests decided if a subject was either “fit to drive,”“temporarily unfit to drive,” or “unfit to drive.” Results. Logistic regression analysis revealed a combination of visual neglect, figure of Rey, and on-road tests as the model that best predicted (R2 = 0.73) fitness to drive after stroke. Using a discriminant function that included the 3 tests of the logistic model, the fitness to drive judgments of 59 (86.8%) subjects were correctly predicted. The sensitivity and specificity of the predictions were 79.4% and 94.1%, respectively. Conclusion. Fitness to drive after stroke can be predicted from performance on a few road-related tests with a high degree of accuracy. However, some individuals require extended assessments and further tests."
417,Prediction of Premixed Flame Dynamics Using Large Eddy Simulation With Tabulated Chemistry and Eulerian Stochastic Fields,A. Avdonin;A. Javareshkian;W. Polifke,Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power,"This paper demonstrates that a large Eddy simulation (LES) combustion model based on tabulated chemistry and Eulerian stochastic fields can successfully describe the flame dynamics of a premixed turbulent swirl flame. The combustion chemistry is tabulated from one-dimensional burner-stabilized flamelet computations in dependence on progress variable and enthalpy. The progress variable allows to efficiently include a detailed reaction scheme, while the dependence on enthalpy describes the effect of heat losses on the reaction rate. The turbulence-chemistry interaction is modeled by eight Eulerian stochastic fields. An LES of a premixed swirl burner with a broadband velocity excitation is performed to investigate the flame dynamics, i.e., the response of heat release rate to upstream velocity perturbations. In particular, the flame impulse response and the flame transfer function (FTF) are identified from LES time series data. Simulation results for a range of power ratings are in good agreement with the experimental data."

419,Prediction of free recall from word-association measures: A replication.,A. Bodin;L. Crapsi;M. Deak;T. Morday;L. Rust,Journal of Experimental Psychology: General,"Mean recall frequency of 99 Kent-Rosanoff words was investigated as a function of cue number, a measure of intralist association. Word cards were shuffled and viewed for 5 sec. each by 15 female and 13 male undergraduate Ss, 17-19 yr. old. Following a 15-min. rest, Ss had 5 min. for written recall. Results showed a significant relationship between cue number (Nc) and mean recall frequency. Peaks and valleys graphed from replication and original data matched and coincided with Nc's unique to one word, suggesting these fluctuations reflect particular, not random effects. Cue linkage increased with Nc and depended on association strength between cuing and cue-linked words, replicating original findings, and, originally unreported, favored early recall."

Charpentier;D. Friedman;S. Wolden;C. Schwartz;D. Yehia;G. Mikhaeel;G. Smith;C. Pinnix;B. Dabaja,International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics,"To evaluate whether clinical risk factors could further distinguish children with intermediate-risk Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) with rapid early and complete anatomic response (RER/CR) who benefit significantly from involved-field RT (IFRT) from those who do not, and thereby aid refinement of treatment selection.Children with intermediate-risk HL treated on the Children's Oncology Group AHOD 0031 trial who achieved RER/CR with 4 cycles of chemotherapy, and who were randomized to 21-Gy IFRT or no additional therapy (n=716) were the subject of this study. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to identify factors associated with clinically and statistically significant improvement in event-free survival (EFS) after randomization to IFRT. Bootstrap sampling was used to evaluate the robustness of the findings.Although most RER/CR patients did not benefit significantly from IFRT, those with a combination of anemia and bulky limited-stage disease (n=190) had significantly better 4-year EFS with the addition of IFRT (89.3% vs 77.9% without IFRT; P=.019); this benefit was consistently reproduced in bootstrap analyses and after adjusting for other prognostic factors.Although most patients achieving RER/CR had favorable outcomes with 4 cycles of chemotherapy alone, those children with initial bulky stage I/II disease and anemia had significantly better EFS with the addition of IFRT as part of combined-modality therapy. Further work evaluating the interaction of clinical and biologic factors and imaging response is needed to further optimize and refine treatment selection."
422,Predictors of driving in individuals with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis,A. Akinwuntan;H. Devos;L. Stepleman;R. Casillas;R. Rahn;S. Smith;M.

The model that explained the highest variance of participants’ performance on a standardized road test was identified using multiple regression analysis. A discriminant equation containing the tests included in the best model was used to predict pass or fail performance on the test.Performance on 12 cognitive and three visual tests were significantly associated with performance on the road test. Five of the tests together explained 59% of the variance and predicted the pass or fail outcome of the road test with 91% accuracy, 70% sensitivity, and 97% specificity.Participants’ on-road performance was more accurately predicted by the model identified in this study than using only performance on the SDSA test battery. The five psychometric/off-road tests should be used as a screening battery, after which a follow-up road test should be conducted to finally decide the fitness to drive of individuals with relapsing–remitting MS. Future studies are needed to confirm and validate the findings in this study."
423,Preparation and characteristics of agricultural waste activated carbon by physical activation having micro- and mesopores,A. Aworn;P. Thiravetyan;W. Nakbanpote,Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis,"Micro–mesoporous activated carbons were prepared from various agricultural wastes by physical activation. Agricultural wastes such as macadamia nut-shell, corncob, bagasse bottom ash, sawdust fly ash and rice husk fly ash, were optimized and processed to obtain the highest surface area. The effects of the amount of volatile matter in char, the activating agent, the activating temperature and kind of raw materials were investigated in terms of porosity development. It was found that the amount of volatile matter, 17–25% or 300–500 °C suitable for pore development depended on the type of raw material. In addition, the activating agents (CO2 and steam) can differentially improve the porosity of the materials. Corncob and sawdust fly ash activated by CO2 and macadamia nut-shell and bagasse bottom ash activated by steam obtained the same high surface area. Among these materials, bagasse bottom ash and sawdust fly ash had a mesopore volume than other materials including commercial activated carbon. Therefore, both of these materials can be alternative adsorbents to adsorb large molecule of organic compounds.Micro–mesoporous activated carbons were prepared from various agricultural wastes by physical activation.

Nakbanpote,Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects,"Activated carbon was produced from corncob using CO2 for the activation process. This research investigated the effect of the remaining volatile matter in corncob char combined with CO2 activation to improve the pore properties of corncob activated carbon. The pore structure was characterized using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area test, total pore volume, mesopore volume, micropore volume and average pore diameter. This study discovered that the amount of volatile matter in corncob char is about 17–25% and results in a BET surface area range of 919–986 m2 g−1 by the CO2 activation process. Therefore, the optimum temperature for the activation process should start at 450–550 °C and increase until the temperature reaches to 800 °C. Activated carbon from corncobs at 450–550 °C contained a suitable amount of volatile matter, 17–25%, for pore development.

Blanco;H. Delmas;F. Gayet;R. Poli,ChemCatChem,"A series of well‐defined polystyrene‐supported tertiary phosphine ligands were prepared by copper‐catalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), involving direct copolymerization of styrene and 4‐diphenylphosphinostyrene (or 4‐styryldiphenylphosphine, SDPP). Copolymerization of the two monomers at different molar ratios showed a decreasing level of control as the SDPP molar fraction (fSDPP) increased. A satisfactory level of control was achieved for fSDPP≤0.25 such that there was a constant concentration of growing “living chains”, and linear Mn growth with conversion and low dispersity. Copper‐free polymers with different chain lengths were prepared and tested as polymeric ligands in the rhodium‐catalyzed hydroformylation of 1‐octene. The polymeric ligands yielded higher linear/branched selectivity and lower activity relative to PPh3 at the same P/Rh ratio. The selectivity increased slightly as a function of the polymer chain length."

In multivariate analyses, the odds of having a revisit were higher for patients with a chronic condition (odds ratio [OR]: 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.86‐1.96), higher severity scores (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.40‐1.45), and age <1 year (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.22‐1.42). The odds of hospitalization on return were higher for patients with higher severity (OR: 3.42, 95% CI: 3.23‐3.62), chronic conditions (OR: 2.92, 95% CI: 2.75‐3.10), age <1 year (1.7–2.5 times the odds of other age groups), overnight arrival (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.71‐1.97), and private insurance (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.39‐1.56). Sickle cell disease and cancer patients had the highest rates of return at 10.7% and 7.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Multiple patient‐ and visit‐level factors are associated with revisits. These factors may provide insight in how to optimize care and decrease avoidable ED utilization. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2014;9:779–787. © 2014 Society of Hospital Medicine"
429,Prevalence of Personality Disorders Among Combat Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,A. Bollinger;D. Riggs;D. Blake;J. Ruzek,Journal of Traumatic Stress,"Many combat veterans with PTSD have co-occurring symptoms of other forms of psychopathology; however, there have been limited studies examining personality disorders among this population. The few extant studies typically have assessed only two or three personality disorders or examined a small sample, resulting in an incomplete picture and scope of comorbidity. This study assessed all DSM-III-R personality disorders in 107 veterans in a specialized, inpatient unit. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R Personality Disorders, 79.4% of the participants were diagnosed with at least one personality disorder: 29.9% received only one diagnosis, 21.5% had two, 15.9% had three, and 12.1% had four or more. The most frequent single diagnoses were Avoidant (47.2%), Paranoid (46.2%), Obsessive-Compulsive (28.3%), and Antisocial (15.1%) personality disorders."
430,Prevalence of anaphylaxis among adults admitted to critical care for severe asthma exacerbation,A. Akenroye;A. Ajala;E. Azimi-Nekoo;G. Vos,Emergency Medicine Journal,"Background In asthmatics, making a diagnosis of anaphylaxis could be challenging as respiratory symptoms are a common feature of both conditions. Identifying anaphylaxis is important to providing appropriate care. A prior study showed that anaphylaxis is sometimes misdiagnosed as acute asthma in children. We sought to identify the percentage of adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with asthma exacerbations who met criteria for anaphylaxis.Methods Retrospective chart review of adults admitted with acute asthma to the ICU at Jacobi Medical Center, a Level 1 trauma centre in Bronx, New York. Study period was January 2012 to December 2014. Using the criteria outlined in the World Allergy Organization’s Anaphylaxis Guidelines, we identified patients who met criteria for anaphylaxis.Results 105 patients were identified: 17 were excluded because their main reason(s) for admission was not asthma. 7 (8%) of the 88 cases eligible for the study met diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis while 3 (3.4%) were highly likely to have had anaphylaxis. The baseline characteristics of the seven patients were similar to that of the overall population studied. They however had shorter onset of symptoms (median (IQR): 3.5 (2–6) vs 24 hours (12–72), p&lt;0.001), were more likely to have been intubated (71%vs31%, p=0.04), received intramuscular epinephrine by the emergency medical services or in the emergency room (86%vs42%, p=0.04) and received antihistamines (28.6%vs1.2%, p=0.02). None of these seven patients died. Only one of the seven patients was prescribed an epinephrine pen injector and referred to an allergist at discharge.Conclusion In this single-centre retrospective review, 3.4% of adults admitted to the ICU for acute severe asthma also met criteria for anaphylaxis."
431,Prevalence of and Risk Factors for Human Rhinovirus Infection in Healthy Aboriginal and Non-Aboriginal Western Australian Children,A. Annamalay;S. Khoo;P. Jacoby;J. Bizzintino;G. Zhang;G. Chidlow;W. Lee;H. Moore;G. Harnett;D. Smith;J. Gern;P. Lesouef;I. Laing;D. Lehmann,Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal,"Background: Human rhinovirus (HRV) species C (HRV-C) have been associated with frequent and severe acute lower respiratory infections and asthma in hospitalized children. The prevalence of HRV-C among healthy children and whether this varies with ethnicity is unknown. Objective: To describe the prevalence of HRV species and their associations with demographic, environmental and socioeconomic factors in healthy Aboriginal and non- Aboriginal children. Methods: Respiratory viruses and bacteria were identified in 1006 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from a cohort of 79 Aboriginal and 88 non- Aboriginal Western Australian children before 2 years of age. HRV-positive nasopharyngeal aspirates were typed for HRV species and genotypes. Longitudinal growth models incorporating generalized estimating equations were used to investigate associations between HRV species and potential risk factors. Results: Of the 159 typed specimens, we identified 83 (52.2%) human rhinovirus species A (HRV-A), 26 (16.4%), human rhinovirus species B and 50 (31.4%) HRV-C. HRV-C was associated with upper respiratory symptoms in Aboriginal (odds ratio, 3.77; 95% confidence interval:1.05–13.55) and non- Aboriginal children (odds ratio, 5.85; 95% confidence interval: 2.33–14.66). HRV-A and HRV-C were associated with carriage of respiratory bacteria. In Aboriginal children, HRV-A was more common in the summer and in those whose mothers were employed prior to delivery. In non- Aboriginal children, day-care attendance and exclusive breast-feeding at age 6–8 weeks were associated with detection of HRV-A, and gestational smoking with detection of HRV-C. Conclusions: Factors associated with the presence of HRV differ between Aboriginal and non- Aboriginal children. In contrast to HRV-A, HRV-C is associated with upper respiratory symptoms suggesting that HRV-C is likely to be implicated in respiratory illness."
432,Preventing the Collision of Requests From Slave Clocks in the Precision Time Protocol (PTP),A. Ciuffoletti,IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement,"The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) distributes a time reference across a network. It specifically addresses demanding environments, where it can reach sub microsecond precision using appropriate technologies. Its scalability is primarily limited by packet delay variations induced by packet collisions. While it is possible to avoid collisions with non-PTP packets using traffic management technologies, collision between PTP packets is an open problem in large systems with critical clock precision requirements. We propose a coordination algorithm that avoids the occurrence of such collisions. It assumes that the master clock, which is the timing reference source, can send a packet in multicast to the slaves: this is not a restrictive hypothesis, since PTP itself takes advantage of this kind of connectivity, and it is also compatible with typical wireless environments. The algorithm operates without introducing additional traffic, it ensures an upper bound to the time between two successive synchronizations of any given slave, it does not alter the structure of the standard PTP messages, it envisions a dynamic number of slaves, it tolerates the replacement of the master with a hot spare in case of failure, and does not rely on specialized hardware. The algorithm has a footprint that does not insist on activities that are already time sensitive, and its operation is mostly concentrated on the master. The algorithm inherits security and fault tolerance limits from PTP: in particular this refers to malicious nodes, and to broken devices that may jam the network."
433,Prevention of Catalyst Deactivation in the Hydrogenolysis of Glycerol by Ga2O3-Modified Copper/Zinc Oxide Catalysts,A. Bienholz;R. Blume;A. Knop-Gericke;F. Girgsdies;M. Behrens;P. Claus,Journal of Physical Chemistry C,"Copper/zinc oxide catalysts prepared by coprecipitation were proved to be highly active and selective in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol. However, they suffer from strong deactivation in the course of reaction. Modifying the CuO/ZnO catalyst with Ga2O3 extremely enhances the stability of the catalyst as even after four consecutive experiments over a Cu/ZnO/Ga2O3 catalyst no deactivation is observed. The catalysts were characterized by temperature-programmed reduction, powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. As the Cu/ZnO/Ga2O3 catalyst is stable even under harsh reaction conditions of 220 °C and in the presence of water, a space-time-yield as high as 22.1 gpropylene glycol/(gCu h) can be obtained."
434,Principal Schottky Bundles over Riemann surfaces,A. Casimiro;S. Ferreira;C. Florentino,ArXiv Mathematics,"We introduce and study (strict) Schottky G-bundles over a compact Riemann surface X, where G is a connected reductive algebraic group. Strict Schottky representations are shown to be related to branes in the moduli space of G-Higgs bundles over X, and we prove that all Schottky $G$-bundles have trivial topological type. Generalizing the Schottky moduli map introduced in Florentino to the setting of principal bundles, we prove its local surjectivity at the good and unitary locus. Finally, we prove that the Schottky map is surjective onto the space of flat bundles for two special classes: when G is an abelian group over an arbitrary X, and the case of a general G-bundle over an elliptic curve."
435,Privacy-preserving anomaly detection in cloud with lightweight homomorphic encryption,A. Alabdulatif;H. Kumarage;I. Khalil;X. Yi,Journal of Computer and System Sciences,"Anomaly detection on large-scale, complex and dynamic data is an essential service that is vital to enable smart functionality in most systems. Increased reliance on cloud computing infrastructures to process such data pose critical challenges with regard to security and privacy. This paper introduces a practical framework that takes advantage of cloud resources to provide a lightweight and scalable privacy preserving anomaly detection service for sensor data. A lightweight Homomorphic Encryption scheme is used to ensure data security and privacy with any computational limitations overcome through a convenient data processing model that employs a single private server collaborating with a set of public servers within a cloud data centre. Virtual nodes implemented on public servers perform granular anomaly detection operations on encrypted data. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates consistently high detection accuracy with less overheads in a cloud-based anomaly detection model that is both lightweight and scalable while ensuring data privacy."
436,Privacy-preserving anomaly detection in the cloud for quality assured decision-making in smart cities,A. Alabdulatif;I. Khalil;H. Kumarage;A. Zomaya;X. Yi,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,"Rapid urbanisation places extensive demands on city services and infrastructure that mandate innovative and sustainable solutions which increasingly involve streamlined monitoring, collection, storage and analysis of massive, heterogeneous data. Analytics services, such as anomaly detection, work to both extract knowledge and support decision-making mechanisms that enable smart functionality over such contexts. However, data privacy and data quality remain significant challenges to assuring the quality of decision-making. This paper introduces a scalable, cloud-based model to provide a privacy preserving anomaly detection service for quality assured decision-making in smart cities. Homomorphic encryption is employed to preserve data privacy during the analysis and MapReduce based distribution of tasks and parallelisation is used to overcome computational overheads associated with homomorphic encryption. Experiments demonstrate that a high level of accuracy is maintained for anomaly detection performed on encrypted data with the adopted distributed data processing approach significantly reducing associated computational overheads."
437,Proactive or Protective? Dimensions of and Advocacy Activities Associated with Reported Policy Change by Nonprofit Organizations,A. Buffardi;R. Pekkanen;S. Smith,Voluntas,"Nonprofit and voluntary associations have a long history of defending the rights of their members, clients, and the public. Despite a burgeoning literature on advocacy by nonprofit organizations, few studies attempt to answer a central question: what factors influence nonprofit success in achieving the changes they aim to affect? Using original data from nearly 400 US nonprofits, we examine the extent to which they were involved in changing public policy, the nature of this engagement, and advocacy activities, organizational characteristics and relationships with others associated with reported policy change. More than three quarters of respondents reported having enacted, stopped, or modified policy. Nonprofits more often reported proactively changing policy when working in partnership and reactively stopping or modifying policy when facing opposition groups. Providing expertise and attending meetings was associated with reported policy change, whereas placing opinion ads was not.Les organismes sans but lucratif et bénévoles défendent depuis longtemps les droits de leurs membres, de leurs clients et du public.

440,Producing molten metal droplets smaller than the nozzle diameter using a pneumatic drop-on-demand generator,A. Amirzadeh;M. Raessi;S. Chandra,Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science,"A pneumatic droplet generator to produce molten metal droplets smaller than the nozzle diameter is described. The generator consists of a heated cylinder in which a cavity is machined. A nozzle is fit into a stainless steel nozzle holder and attached to the bottom plate of the generator. The system is connected to a gas cylinder through a solenoid valve. Opening the valve for a preset time creates a pulse of alternating negative and positive pressure in the gas above the surface of the molten metal, and a droplet is ejected through the nozzle. The effect of various parameters such as the ejection frequency, nozzle diameter, pulse width and secondary gas flow on droplet formation is investigated. This method made it possible to produce droplets as small as 60% the nozzle diameter. An approximate analytical method is studied to understand the liquid behavior within the nozzle, estimate the droplet size, and investigate the effect of the secondary gas flow pressure on droplet diameter.A pneumatic droplet generator to produce molten metal droplets smaller than the nozzle diameter is described.

It also identifies the pyrolysis of animal fats as a source of high-calorific-value (68−165 MJ/m3) gaseous fuel."
442,Productive organizational energy mediates the impact of organizational structure on absorptive capacity,A. Alexiou;S. Khanagha;M. Schippers,Long Range Planning,"The ability of an organization to cope with radical technological change is regarded to be heavily dependent on its ability to absorb and apply knowledge from its environment. This study investigates the role of organizational structure in driving absorptive capacity and uncovers the role of the emergent phenomenon of organizational energy as the enabler of this relationship. A field study was conducted among firms that are challenged by the disruptive nature of Cloud computing. Our results show that organizational design affects the degree of mobilization of an organization's affective, cognitive and behavioral resources, which in turn influence the effectiveness of learning processes related to the absorption and exchange of knowledge within the organization. Furthermore, they reveal the positive relationship between the enactment of absorptive capacity and the successful adoption of Cloud technology for incumbent firms. The findings contribute to our understanding of the micro-foundations of absorptive capacity and how positive organizational phenomena facilitate effective adoption and implementation of emerging technologies."

445,Promoting renewable energy through capacity markets: An analysis of the Russian support scheme,A. Boute,Energy Policy,"Most existing support schemes aim to stimulate the deployment of renewable energy sources in the electricity sector on the basis of the electricity output (MW h) of renewable energy installations. Support is anchored in the electricity commodity market. In contrast to this established approach, Russia intends to promote renewable energy through the capacity market. The idea is to remunerate investors for the installed capacity (MW) of their installations, in particular for the availability of their installations to produce electricity. This article argues that, contrary to the implicit consensus, a capacity-based approach to supporting renewable energy can provide an alternative to the current output-based schemes. Capacity-based schemes limit the incentive that the operators of renewable energy installations currently have under output-based schemes to deliver electricity to the grid even in periods of low demand. These schemes also provide investors with a more predictable income flow. However, to be successful, the regulation of capacity supply – currently designed for flexible power plants – needs to accommodate the specific production patterns of variable renewable energy installations. This paper examines ways to overcome this challenge in Russia and provides more general conclusions on the complex interaction between capacity markets and renewable energy investments."
446,Protection from harm: the experience of adults after therapy with prolonged‐speech,A. Cream;M. Onslow;A. Packman;G. Llewellyn,International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders,"Background: It is well documented that adults can control stuttering if they use certain novel speech patterns referred to generically as prolonged‐speech (PS). These speech patterns were refined in the 1960s and developed into behavioural treatment programmes. The bulk of available PS treatment research has focused on speech parameters thought to reflect favourable treatment outcome. Considering this, and that post‐treatment relapse is known to be common, clinicians and researchers could be usefully informed by knowledge about the experiences of those who receive these treatments. Subsequently, they could use such information in attempts to control stuttering in their clients. Yet, at present, systematic research on this topic is scant.Aims: The continued development of PS treatments could be usefully informed by research into the experiences of those who use PS to control stuttering. Hence, that is the topic of the present report.Methods & Procedures: The method used was phenomenology. Participants were a purposive sample of 10 people who had received PS treatment. During a 2‐year period, a collaborative approach to the study of the topic was developed between the participants and interviewer. Interviews were from 1.5 to 2 hours, and a total of 34 interviews and discussions were undertaken with participants. Transcripts of these were used to generate text from which themes were identified using line‐by‐line, holistic and selective approaches.Outcomes & Results: The main findings were that even after therapy with PS there is a continued risk of stuttering occurring, and although adults have the novel experience of controlling stuttering, they also continue to experience feeling different from those who do not stutter, which may be exacerbated after therapy. Given the negative consequences associated with stuttering and feeling different, the essence of the experience after therapy with PS is that adults use their own resources to integrate behavioural skills with existing experiences in order to protect themselves from the harm of stuttering as best they can. PS changes speech, but not the dynamic and often unpredictable communication situations of everyday life. Hence, the maximum benefits of PS are attained when clients use a strategic approach to control stuttered speech and daily communication.Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the results of existing outcome research as well as with other current research from the present group. Their implications are discussed in relation to the structure of PS treatments as well as in relation to future PS outcome research. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed in terms of informing prospective clients of the experiential consequences of PS, selecting clients who might benefit from PS and in terms of assisting clients to achieve optimal benefits from PS."
447,Protective Effect of Seleno-l-Methionine on Cyclophosphamide-Induced Urinary Bladder Toxicity in Rats,A. Ayhanci;S. Yaman;V. Sahinturk;R. Uyar;G. Bayramoglu;H. Senturk;Y. Altuner;S. Appak;S. Gunes,Biological Trace Element Research,"Cyclophosphamide (CP) is a widely used antineoplastic drug, which could cause toxicity of the normal cells due to its toxic metabolites. Its urotoxicity may cause dose-limiting side effects like hemorrhagic cystitis. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during inflammation is one of the reasons of the urothelial injury. Selenoproteins play crucial roles in regulating ROS and redox status in nearly all tissues; therefore, in this study, the urotoxicity of CP and the possible protective effects of seleno-l-methionine (SLM) on urinary bladder of rats were investigated. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg CP induced cystitis, in a dose-dependent manner, as manifested by marked congestion, edema and extravasation in rat urinary bladder, a marked desquamative damage to the urothelium, severe inflammation in the lamina propria, focal erosions, and polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes associated with occasional lymphocyte infiltration determined by macroscopic and histopathological examination. In rat urinary bladder tissue, a significant decrease in the endogenous antioxidant compound glutathione, and elevation of lipid peroxidation were also noted. Pretreatment with SLM (0.5 or 1 mg/kg) produced a significant decrease in the bladder edema and caused a marked decrease in vascular congestion and hemorrhage and a profound improvement in the histological structure. Moreover, SLM pretreatment decreased lipid peroxide significantly in urinary bladder tissue, and glutathione content was greatly restored. These results suggest that SLM offers protective effects against CP-induced urinary bladder toxicity and could be used as a protective agent against the drug toxicity."
448,Protective Effect of Zinc on Cyclophosphamide-Induced Hematoxicity and Urotoxicity,A. Ayhanci;R. Uyar;E. Aral;S. Kabadere;S. Appak,Biological Trace Element Research,"Cyclophosphamide (CP) is widely used for the treatment of neoplastic diseases; however, its toxicity causes dose-limiting side effects. Zinc (Zn) is an essential trace element and has important biological functions that control many cell processes including DNA synthesis, normal growth, reproduction, fetal development, bone formation, and wound healing. Therefore, the toxicity of CP and the possible protective effect of Zn on blood cells, bone marrow, and bladder of rat were investigated in this study. Intraperitoneal administration of 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg CP for 3 days caused, in a dose-dependent manner, reductions in the number of leukocytes, thrombocytes, and bone marrow nucleated cells and a serious urotoxicity. To explore whether CP-induced damages could be prevented by Zn, other groups of rats were pretreated with 4 or 8 mg/kg ZnCl2 intraperitoneally for 3 days then challenged with respective doses of CP plus ZnCl2 on day 4 for three more days. The results indicated that treatment of rats with Zn could dose-dependently alleviate CP-induced toxicities on blood cells, bone marrow cells, and urinary bladder. We suggest that Zn could be a potentially effective drug in the prevention of CP-related hematoxicity and urotoxicity."
449,Protective Effects of Boron on Cyclophosphamide-Induced Bladder Damage and Oxidative Stress in Rats,A. Ayhanci;D. Tanriverdi;V. Sahinturk;M. Cengiz;S. Appak-Baskoy;I. Sahin,Biological Trace Element Research,"This study aims to investigate protective effects of boron against cyclophosphamide-induced bladder toxicity that produces oxidative stress and leads to apoptosis of the cells. In total, 24 rats were divided into 4 equal groups. The control group received saline. The 2nd experimental group received 200 mg kg of cyclophosphamide i.p. on the 4th day while the 3rd group was given only boron (200 mg kg, i.p.) for 6 days. In the 4th group, boron was given for 6 days and cyclophosphamide (200 mg kg, i.p.) was administrated on the 4th day. Twenty-four hours after the last boron or cyclophosphamide administration, rats were sacrificed under anesthesia. Bladder tissues of rats were taken for histological and immunohistochemical (apoptotic markers such as caspase-3, bcl-2, and bax) and blood was taken for the biochemical (serum total thiol, serum natural thiol, serum thiol-disulfide) analysis. Transient epithelial thinning, edema, marked inflammatory reaction, and bleeding were observed in bladders of the group that received cyclophosphamide. Also, the activity of bax and caspase-3-positive cells increased while the number of bcl-2-positive cells decreased. In the same group, serum natural thiol and total thiol levels decreased while serum disulfide levels increased, which indicates oxidative stress. On the other hand, in the boron+cyclophosphamide group pretreatment with boron protected, the bladder tissue and the number of bcl-2-positive cells increased, and bax and caspase-3-positive cells decreased, showing antiapoptotic effects of boron against cyclophosphamide-induced toxicity. In parallel with the findings of this group, native thiol and total thiol levels increased and serum disulfide levels decreased pointing out to a decreased oxidative stress. Our results indicate that boron pretreatment significantly protects rat bladder against cyclophosphamide-induced bladder damage due to its antiapoptotic and antioxidant properties."
450,Protective effects of the standardized extract of Zingiber officinale on myocardium against isoproterenol-induced biochemical and histopathological alterations in rats,A. Amran;I. Jantan;R. Dianita;F. Buang,Pharmaceutical Biology,"Context: Ginger [Zingiber officinale Roscoe. (Zingiberaceae)] has been universally used as a spice as well as for its health benefits.Objective: The present study evaluates the protective effect of the standardized extract of ginger against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction (MI) in rats.Materials and methods: Wistar rats were pretreated orally with three doses of standardized ginger extract (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg of body weight) or propranolol (5 mg/mL) for 28 d prior to ISO (85 mg/kg) induced MI in two doses on days 29 and 30. The rats were sacrificed 48 h after the first induction; serum and hearts were collected for biochemical and histopathological analysis.Results: Gingerols and shogaols were identified and quantitatively analyzed in the extracts using validated reversed phase HPLC methods. Pretreatment with ginger extract at 400 mg/kg showed a significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in all the cardiac enzyme activities, i.e., cardiac troponin I (cTnI) (0.57 ng/mL), creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB) (10.34 pg/mL), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (115.22 U/L), alanine transaminase (ALT) (15.79 U/L), and aspartate transaminase (AST) (46.72 U/L) when compared with ISO-control rats. There were significant rises (p &lt; 0.05) in the activity of glutathione peroxide (GPx) (53.16 U/L), catalase (CAT) (210.41 U/L), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (280.89 U/mL) of the pretreated rats when compared with the ISO-control. Histopathological examination showed an improvement in membrane cell integrity in pretreated rats compared with untreated rats.Conclusion: The ethanol extract of ginger exhibited cardioprotective potential in treating myocardial injury following ISO administration."
451,Proteomic footprint of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury: Longitudinal study of the at-risk and remote regions in the pig model,A. Binek;R. Fernández-Jiménez;I. Jorge;E. Camafeita;J. López;N. Bagwan;C. Galán-Arriola;A. Pun;J. Agüero;V. Fuster;B. Ibanez;J. Vázquez,Scientific Reports (Biochemistry),"Reperfusion alters post-myocardial infarction (MI) healing; however, very few systematic studies report the early molecular changes following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Alterations in the remote myocardium have also been neglected, disregarding its contribution to post-MI heart failure (HF) development. This study characterizes protein dynamics and contractile abnormalities in the ischemic and remote myocardium during one week after MI. Closed-chest 40 min I/R was performed in 20 pigs sacrificed at 120 min, 24 hours, 4days, and 7days after reperfusion (n = 5 per group). Myocardial contractility was followed up by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and tissue samples were analyzed by multiplexed quantitative proteomics. At early reperfusion (120 min), the ischemic area showed a coordinated upregulation of inflammatory processes, whereas interstitial proteins, angiogenesis and cardio-renal signaling processes increased at later reperfusion (day 4 and 7). Remote myocardium showed decreased contractility at 120 min- and 24 h-CMR accompanied by transient alterations in contractile and mitochondrial proteins. Subsequent recovery of regional contractility was associated with edema formation on CMR and increases in inflammation and wound healing proteins on post-MI day 7. Our results establish for the first time the altered protein signatures in the ischemic and remote myocardium early after I/R and might have implications for new therapeutic targets to improve early post-MI remodeling."
452,Psychological and clinical correlates of posttraumatic growth in cancer: A systematic and critical review,A. Casellas‐Grau;C. Ochoa;C. Ruini,Psycho-Oncology,"Objective The objective of this study is to describe major findings on posttraumatic growth (PTG) in cancer, by analyzing its various definitions, assessment tools, and examining its main psychological and clinical correlates. Methods A search in relevant databases (PsycINFO, Pubmed, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science) was performed using descriptors related to the positive reactions in cancer. Articles were screened by title, abstract, and full text. Results Seventy‐two met the inclusion criteria. Most articles (46%) focused on breast cancer, used the PTG inventory (76%), and had a cross‐sectional design (68%). The PTG resulted inversely associated with depressive and anxious symptoms and directly related to hope, optimism, spirituality, and meaning. Illness‐related variables have been poorly investigated compared to psychological ones. Articles found no relationship between cancer site, cancer surgery, cancer recurrence, and PTG. Some correlations emerged with the elapsed time since diagnosis, type of oncological treatment received, and cancer stage. Only few studies differentiated illness‐related–life‐threatening stressors from other forms of trauma, and the potentially different mechanisms connected with PTG outcome in cancer patients. Conclusions The evaluation of PTG in cancer patients is worthy, because it may promote a better adaption to the illness. However, many investigations do not explicitly refer to the medical nature of the trauma, and they may have not completely captured the full spectrum of positive reactions in cancer patients. Future research should better investigate issues such as health attitudes; the risks of future recurrences; and the type, quality, and efficacy of medical treatments received and their influence on PTG in cancer patients."

Rinaldi,Composites Part B: Engineering,"The ultimate behavior of thin reinforced concrete structures, such as slabs, can be governed by punching due to point loads. This premature brittle failure mode can occur in bridge deck slabs, often subjected to severe conditions of loads concentrated in small areas, and characterized by a reduced thickness. In this kind of structures, a proper punching reinforcement is not applicable, but the local and global behavior can be improved by the addition of short fibers. Three full-scale slabs, simulating bridge decks, were tested in the Laboratory of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, to investigate the effect of lightweight fiber reinforced material on the punching shear resistance. Furthermore, ashes coming from the combustion of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), with pozzolanic reaction, were added to the concrete mix. The obtained results are presented, discussed and compared with the MC2010 provisions.The ultimate behavior of thin reinforced concrete structures, such as slabs, can be governed by punching due to point loads.

Ros,Inorganica Chimica Acta,"Reactions of the ligands 1-hydroxymethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazole (HL1), 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3,5-dimethylpyrazole (HL2) and 1-(3-hydroxypropyl)-3,5-dimethylpyrazole (HL3) with [PdCl2(CH3CN)2] lead to trans-[PdCl2(HL)2] complexes. The ligands are co-ordinated to the Pd(II) by a N atom of the pyrazolic ring in a trans disposition. Two chlorides complete the environment of the metallic atom. These Pd(II) complexes were characterised by elemental analyses, conductivity measurements and IR, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies and X-ray diffraction. The NMR study of the complexes is consistent with a very slow rotation of ligands around the PdN bond, so that two conformational isomers can be observed in solution. The crystal structures of [PdCl2(HL)2] (HL=HL1, HL2) complexes are described. These complexes react with AgNO3 to give [Pd(NO3)(HL)2]NO3 compounds."
457,Pyrolysis of Waste Fryer Grease in a Fixed-Bed Reactor,A. Adebanjo;M. Kulkarni;A. Dalai;N. Bakhshi,Energy & Fuels,"Waste fryer grease (WFG) is an environmentally preferable option for hydrogen production. In the present work, the pyrolysis of waste fryer grease in the absence of catalyst was studied in a fixed-bed reactor. The effects of various operating parameters such as reaction temperature (650−850 °C), carrier gas (N2) flow rate (30−70 mL/min), and reactor inert packing particle size (0.5−2.5 mm) on hydrogen and syngas (i.e., mixture of H2 + CO) production were studied. Quadratic response surface models used in analyzing the product gas and char data showed that temperature was the most important parameter over the wide range of conditions studied. The effect of particle size on the product gas and char yield was not significant. Residence time influenced both hydrogen and syngas composition, but its effect was smaller than that of temperature. Numerical optimization of the responses gave a composition of 17.8 mol % for hydrogen, 26.6 mol % for syngas, and a char yield of 13.7 g/100 g of waste fryer grease. Steam was introduced in the reaction system to increase the hydrogen production. The addition of steam (a steam to carbon ratio of 1.5) caused a drastic increase in the hydrogen production to a maximum of 56.2 mol % and in syngas to a maximum of 82.4 mol %."
458,Pyrolytic behaviour of microcystins and microcystin-spiked algal blooms,A. Camean;I. Moreno;T. Verdejo;F. González-Vila;J. González-Pérez,Journal of Analytical and Applied Pyrolysis,"This work describes the pyrolytic behaviour of microcystin (MC) standards using both conventional analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC–MS) and thermochemolysis with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). In both cases, the pyrolytic patterns of the MCs at low pyrolysis temperature were structure-dependant, which confirms that pyrolytic techniques are suitable to readily distinguish between different types of MCs. However, the different types of amino acids conforming the structure of the MCs were distinguished only after TMAH/thermochemolysis. In order to examine the suitability of such techniques as a potential tool in the analysis of MC in cyanobacterial algae blooms, pyrolytic experiments using cyanobacterial cultures spiked with the microcystin LR (MC-LR) were also performed. The results suggest that pyrolytic techniques could be used for the rapid and safe detection of toxins in cyanobacterial blooms. Although promissory, further work directed to technique optimization would be necessary before this methodology is used as a routine detection method.This work describes the pyrolytic behaviour of microcystin (MC) standards using both conventional analytical pyrolysis (Py-GC–MS) and thermochemolysis with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH).

459,Quantification of the Impact of Uncertainties in Operating Conditions on the Flame Transfer Function With Nonintrusive Polynomial Chaos Expansion,A. Avdonin;W. Polifke,Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power,"Nonintrusive polynomial chaos expansion (NIPCE) is used to quantify the impact of uncertainties in operating conditions on the flame transfer function (FTF) of a premixed laminar flame. NIPCE requires only a small number of system evaluations, so it can be applied in cases where a Monte Carlo simulation is unfeasible. We consider three uncertain operating parameters: inlet velocity, burner plate temperature, and equivalence ratio. The FTF is identified in terms of the finite impulse response (FIR) from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with broadband velocity excitation. NIPCE yields uncertainties in the FTF due to the uncertain operating conditions. For the chosen uncertain operating bounds, a second-order expansion is found to be sufficient to represent the resulting uncertainties in the FTF with good accuracy. The effect of each operating parameter on the FTF is studied using Sobol indices, i.e., a variance-based measure of sensitivity, which are computed from the NIPCE. It is observed that in the present case, uncertainties in the FIR as well as in the phase of the FTF are dominated by the equivalence-ratio uncertainty. For frequencies below 150 Hz, the uncertainty in the gain of the FTF is also attributable to the uncertainty in equivalence-ratio, but for higher frequencies, the uncertainties in velocity and temperature dominate. At last, we adopt the polynomial approximation of the output quantity, provided by the NIPCE method, for further uncertainty quantification (UQ) studies with modified input uncertainties."
460,Quantitative analysis of product categorization in soft drinks using bottle silhouettes,A. Arboleda;C. Arce-Lopera,Food Quality and Preference,"In our daily life, we use our senses to acquire information about the objects that surround us. However, the information processing that allows for the recognition and consecutive classification of those objects into categories remains unclear. Our purpose is to analyze the categorization mechanism taking into account: (a) package visual metrics and (b) consumer perceptions of this basic visual information. First of all, we quantitatively analyzed the physical characteristics of 52 bottle silhouettes of seven soft drink categories: sports drinks, water, flavored water, sodas, fruit juices, malt drinks and tea. We found that measures of the shape of the bottles can model the membership to a product category. Our first experiment tested how accurately consumers could recognize product category from real bottle silhouettes. We found that the visual characteristics that differentiate product category silhouettes are lid width and bottle shape (body kurtosis). Our second experiment tested the capacity of consumers to recognize artificially created bottle silhouettes. When basic information, such as the product shape is modified, consumers are not always capable of recognizing its corresponding category. We concluded that the physical attributes of bottles are related to the categorization process of the bottle content made by consumers. These findings may provide guidelines for new bottle designs that capitalize on existing categorization rules based on consumer perception.We related consumers’ cognitive categorization process to visual physical characteristics.The lid width and the body kurtosis are important visual cues for categorization.Individuals are able to assign a product to its category by using an average silhouette.In our daily life, we use our senses to acquire information about the objects that surround us.

Hagni,Minerals Engineering,"Historically, phlogopite and olivine have been mined in the Silver City Dome District in Kansas, USA, from lamproite ultra-potassic igneous rock for use as a supplement in cattle feed. Micro-Lite LLC is now evaluating processing techniques for recovery of phlogopite to be used for reinforcement in plastics, high temperature applications, and electrical insulators, which requires a higher grade phlogopite product. To determine the purity of the processed ore, QEMSCAN® was utilised to identify and quantify phlogopite and impurities, including olivine, pyroxenes, feldspars, titanium phases (mainly titanite and perovskite), apatite, magnetite, chromite, and other phases. Samples were prepared and analysed in a manner to decrease or eliminate preferred orientation of phlogopite to provide accurate quantitative results. The results show that the flotation product has a higher concentration of phlogopite at 87% (by mass), compared to 78% in the hydrosizer product. The main impurity phase in both products is olivine (10% in the flotation product and 18% in the hydrosizer product). In the hydrosizer product, 15% of the sample consists of liberated phlogopite particles, while in the flotation product 58% of the sample occurs as pure, liberated phlogopite particles.Historically, phlogopite and olivine have been mined in the Silver City Dome District in Kansas, USA, from lamproite ultra-potassic igneous rock for use as a supplement in cattle feed.

Siervogel,Journal of Human Hypertension,"Blood pressure (BP) reactivity to orthostatic tilt may be predictive of cardiovascular disease. However, the genetic and environmental influences on BP reactivity to tilt have not been well examined. Identifying different influences on BP at rest and BP during tilt is complicated by the intercorrelation among multiple measurements. In this study, we use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce multivariate BP data into components that are orthogonal. The objective of this study is to characterize and examine the genetic architecture of BP at rest and during head-up tilt (HUT). Specifically, we estimate the heritability of individual BP measures and three principal components (PC) derived from multiple BP measurements during HUT. Additionally, we estimate covariate effects on these traits. The study sample consisted of 444 individuals, distributed across four large families. HUT consisted of 70° head-up table tilting while strapped to a tilt table. BP reactivity (ΔBP) was defined as BP during HUT minus BP while supine. Three PC extracted from the PCA were interpreted as ‘general BP’ (PC1), ‘pulse pressure’ (PC2) and ‘BP reactivity’ (PC3). Variance components methods were used to estimate the heritabilities of resting BP, HUT BP, ΔBP, as well as the three BP PC. Significant (P<0.05) heritabilities were found for all BP measurements, except for systolic ΔBP at 1 and 3 min, and diastolic ΔBP at 2 min.

463,Quantum Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells: Electro-Optical Cavity Considerations,A. Armin;M. Velusamy;P. Wolfer;Y. Zhang;P. Burn;P. Meredith;A. Pivrikas,ACS Photonics,"Organic solar cells (OSCs) are composed of one or more layers of order 100 nm thickness sandwiched between metallic and transparent electrodes. As such, they are low finesse, multilayer optical cavities where the optical field distribution is governed by the complex refractive indices and thicknesses of all layers in the “solar cell stack”. Optical interference and parasitic absorbance in nonactive layers can have a dramatic effect on the shape of the measured external quantum efficiency (EQE), the parameter often used to optimize device structure and derive critical insight regarding charge generation and extraction. In this communication, we study a model high efficiency OSC system (PCDTBT/PC70BM) as a function of active layer thickness, blend composition and processing. The spectral shapes of the measured EQEs show strong thickness and blend ratio dependence. However, when correctly determined, the internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) are spectrally flat. The differences in EQE spectral shape predominantly originate from optical interference and parasitic absorptions rather than charge generation or transport phenomena. We also demonstrate similar results for a second model system (PCPDTBT/PC60BM) in which an energy-dependent “IQE-like” response has recently been used to justify the existence of hot excitons. Once again, we show the origin of these spectral phenomena to be optical, not electronic. These cases highlight the fact that thin film organic solar cells (even single junction) must be properly considered as low finesse electro-optical cavities, a point that is not universally appreciated."
464,Quantum effects of a massive 3-form coupled to a Dirac field,A. Aurilia;E. Spallucci,Physical Review D,"The computation of the quantum vacuum pressure must take into account the contribution of zero-point oscillations of a rank-three gauge field Aμνρ. This result was established in a previous paper where we calculated both the Casimir pressure within a region of vacuum simulating a hadronic bag and the Wilson factor for the three-index potential associated with the boundary of the bag. The resulting “volume law” satisfied by the Wilson loop is consistent with the basic confining requirement that the static interquark potential increases with the distance between two test charges. As a sequel to that paper, we consider here the coupling of Aμνρ to the generic current of a matter field, later identified with the spin density current of a Dirac field. In fact, one of the objectives of this paper is to investigate the impact of the quantum fluctuations of Aμνρ on the effective dynamics of the spinor field. The consistency of the field equations, even at the classical level, requires the introduction of a mass term for Aμνρ. In this case, the Casimir vacuum pressure includes a contribution that is explicitly dependent on the mass of Aμνρ and leads us to conclude that the mass term plays the same role as the infrared cutoff needed to regularize the finite volume partition functional previously calculated in the massless case. Remarkably, even in the presence of a mass term, Aμνρ contains a mixture of massless and massive spin-0 fields so that the resulting equation is still gauge invariant. This is yet another peculiar, but physically relevant property of Aμνρ since it is reflected in the effective dynamics of the spinor fields and confirms the confining property of Aμνρ already expected from the earlier calculation of the Wilson loop."
465,"Quantum fluctuations of a ""constant"" gauge field",A. Aurilia;E. Spallucci,Physical Review D,"It is argued here that the quantum computation of the vacuum pressure must take into account the contribution of zero-point oscillations of a rank-three gauge field. The field Aμνρ possesses no radiative degrees of freedom, its sole function being that of polarizing the vacuum through the formation of finite domains characterized by a non-vanishing, constant, but otherwise arbitrary pressure. This extraordinary feature, rather unique among quantum fields, is exploited to associate the Aμνρ field with the “bag constant” of the hadronic vacuum, or with the cosmological term in the cosmic case. We find that the quantum fluctuations of Aμνρ are inversely proportional to the confinement volume and interpret the result as a Casimir effect for the hadronic vacuum. With these results in hands and by analogy with the electromagnetic and string case, we proceed to calculate the Wilson loop of the three-index potential coupled to a “test” relativistic bubble. From this calculation we extract the static potential between two opposite points on the surface of a spherical bag and find it to be proportional to the enclosed volume."
466,Quantum state smoothing: Why the types of observed and unobserved measurements matter,A. Chantasri;I. Guevara;H. Wiseman,ArXiv Physics,"We investigate the estimation technique called quantum state smoothing introduced by Guevara and Wiseman [Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\bf 115}, 180407 (2015)], which offers a valid quantum state estimate for a partially monitored system, conditioned on the observed record both prior and posterior to an estimation time. Partial monitoring by an observer implies that there may exist records unobserved by that observer. It was shown that, given only the observed record, the observer can better estimate the underlying true quantum states, by inferring the unobserved record and using quantum state smoothing, rather than the usual quantum filtering approach. However, the improvement in estimation fidelity, originally examined for a resonantly driven qubit coupled to two vacuum baths, was also shown to vary depending on the types of detection used for the qubit's fluorescence. In this work, we analyse this variation in a systematic way for the first time. We first define smoothing power using an average purity recovery and a relative average purity recovery, of smoothing over filtering. Then, we explore the power for various combinations of fluorescence detection for both observed and unobserved channels. We next propose a method to explain the variation of the smoothing power, based on multi-time correlation strength between fluorescence detection records. The method gives a prediction of smoothing power for different combinations, which is remarkably successful in comparison with numerically simulated qubit trajectories."
467,Quantum state tomography with time-continuous measurements: reconstruction with resource limitations,A. Chantasri;S. Pang;T. Chalermpusitarak;A. Jordan,ArXiv Physics,"We propose and analyze quantum state estimation (tomography) using continuous quantum measurements with resource limitations, allowing the global state of many qubits to be constructed from only measuring a few. We give a proof-of-principle investigation demonstrating successful tomographic reconstruction of an arbitrary initial quantum state for three different situations: single qubit, remote qubit, and two interacting qubits. The tomographic reconstruction utilizes only a continuous weak probe of a single qubit observable, a fixed coupling Hamiltonian, together with single-qubit controls. In the single qubit case, a combination of the continuous measurement of an observable and a Rabi oscillation is sufficient to find all three unknown qubit state components. For two interacting qubits, where only one observable of the first qubit is measured, the control Hamiltonian can be implemented to transfer all quantum information to the measured observable, via the qubit-qubit interaction and Rabi oscillation controls applied locally on each qubit. We discuss different sets of controls by analyzing the unitary dynamics and the Fisher information matrix of the estimation in the limit of weak measurement, and simulate tomographic results numerically. As a result, we obtained reconstructed state fidelities in excess of 0.98 with a few thousand measurement runs."

Sirlin,Physical Review D,"We study the numerical effects of several renormalization schemes of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix on the top-quark decay widths. We then employ these results to infer the relative shifts in the CKM parameters |Vtq|2 due to the quark mixing renormalization corrections, assuming that they are determined directly from the top-quark partial decay widths, without imposing unitarity constraints.

Aragón,Physical Review Letters,"The eigenfunctions of nested wells with an incommensurate boundary geometry, in both the hydrodynamic shallow water regime and quantum cases, are systematically and exhaustively studied in this Letter. The boundary arrangement of the nested wells consists of polygonal ones, square or hexagonal, with a concentric immersed, similar but rotated, well or plateau. A rich taxonomy of wave patterns, such as quasicrystalline states, their crystalline rational approximants, and some other exotic but well known tilings, is found in these mimicked experiments. To the best of our knowledge, these hydrodynamic rational approximants are presented here for the first time in a hydrodynamic-quantum framework.

Dickman,Physical Review E,"We construct the quasistationary (QS) probability distribution for the Domany-Kinzel stochastic cellular automaton (DKCA), a discrete-time Markov process with an absorbing state. QS distributions are derived at both the one-and two-site levels. We characterize the distributions by their mean, and various moment ratios, and analyze the lifetime of the QS state, and the relaxation time to attain this state. Of particular interest are the scaling properties of the QS state along the critical line separating the active and absorbing phases. These exhibit a high degree of similarity to the contact process and the Malthus-Verhulst process (the closest continuous-time analogs of the DKCA), which extends to the scaling form of the QS distribution."

474,RELIABILITY AND FACTORIAL VALIDITY OF THE WALLACH‐KOGAN CREATIVITY TESTS,A. Cropley;G. Maslany,British Journal of Psychology,"The Wallach‐Kogan tests of ‘creativity’ and the Primary Mental Abilities test were administered to 207 university students. The creativity tests were scored for originality, and KR20 reliabilities calculated. Intercorrelations among the five creativity tests were also calculated and compared with those among the six ‘intelligence’ tests. Results indicated that the Wallach‐Kogan tests were highly reliable, clustered strongly among themselves, and correlated poorly with the intelligence tests. A factor analysis indicated the existence of large loadings of creativity tests on the intelligence factor, and of intelligence tests on the creativity factor."
475,RNA Polymerase III Advances: Structural and tRNA Functional Views,A. Arimbasseri;R. Maraia,Trends in Biochemical Sciences,"The first atomic structures of RNAP III bring novel insight into the mechanisms that promote efficient synthesis of short RNAs. A loose active center, tight DNA-binding cleft, and other features will drive experiments to target RNA synthesis in cancer.A crystal structure of Brf2 with type 3 promoter DNA uncovered a novel switch mechanism for selenocysteine tRNA synthesis and control of the oxidative stress response.The dimethyl-G26 modification found on some tRNAs is linked to RNAP III and regulated by Maf1, which is conserved from yeast to human. Because dimethyl-G26 increases tRNA activity for decoding, it alters cellular mRNA translational profiles.Mutations throughout the two largest RNAP III subunits cause the developmental neurological disorder hypomyelinating leukodystrophy (HLD). These mutations likely decrease tRNA synthesis, affect dimethyl-G26, and alter mRNA translation.RNA synthesis in eukaryotes is divided among three RNA polymerases (RNAPs). RNAP III transcribes hundreds of tRNA genes and fewer additional short RNA genes. We survey recent work on transcription by RNAP III including an atomic structure, mechanisms of action, interactions with chromatin and retroposons, and a conserved link between its activity and a tRNA modification that enhances mRNA decoding. Other new work suggests important mechanistic connections to oxidative stress, autoimmunity and cancer, embryonic stem cell pluripotency, and tissue-specific developmental effects. We consider that, for some of its complex functions, variation in RNAP III activity levels lead to nonuniform changes in tRNAs that can shift the translation profiles of key codon-biased mRNAs with resultant phenotypes or disease states."
476,"RNA Polymerase III Output Is Functionally Linked to tRNA Dimethyl-G26 ModificationWhy tRNAs overproduced in the absence of Maf1, negative regulator of RNAPIII, are not fully functional?",A. Arimbasseri;N. Blewett;J. Iben;T. Lamichhane;V. Cherkasova;M. Hafner;R. Maraia,PLOS Genetics,"Control of the differential abundance or activity of tRNAs can be important determinants of gene regulation. RNA polymerase (RNAP) III synthesizes all tRNAs in eukaryotes and it derepression is associated with cancer. Maf1 is a conserved general repressor of RNAP III under the control of the target of rapamycin (TOR) that acts to integrate transcriptional output and protein synthetic demand toward metabolic economy. Studies in budding yeast have indicated that the global tRNA gene activation that occurs with derepression of RNAP III via maf1-deletion is accompanied by a paradoxical loss of tRNA-mediated nonsense suppressor activity, manifested as an antisuppression phenotype, by an unknown mechanism. We show that maf1-antisuppression also occurs in the fission yeast S. pombe amidst general activation of RNAP III. We used tRNA-HydroSeq to document that little changes occurred in the relative levels of different tRNAs in maf1Δ cells. By contrast, the efficiency of N2,N2-dimethyl G26 (m22G26) modification on certain tRNAs was decreased in response to maf1-deletion and associated with antisuppression, and was validated by other methods. Over-expression of Trm1, which produces m22G26, reversed maf1-antisuppression. A model that emerges is that competition by increased tRNA levels in maf1Δ cells leads to m22G26 hypomodification due to limiting Trm1, reducing the activity of suppressor-tRNASerUCA and accounting for antisuppression. Consistent with this, we show that RNAP III mutations associated with hypomyelinating leukodystrophy decrease tRNA transcription, increase m22G26 efficiency and reverse antisuppression. Extending this more broadly, we show that a decrease in tRNA synthesis by treatment with rapamycin leads to increased m22G26 modification and that this response is conserved among highly divergent yeasts and human cells."
477,RUSTEC: Greening Europe's energy supply by developing Russia's renewable energy potential,A. Boute;P. Willems,Energy Policy,"The North-West of Russia is characterized by a large renewable energy resource base in geographic proximity to the EU. At the same time, EU Member States are bound by mandatory renewable energy targets which could prove to be costly to achieve in the current budgetary context and which often face strong local opposition. Directive 2009/28/EC on Renewable Energy makes it possible for Member States to achieve their targets by importing electricity produced from renewable energy sources from non-EU countries. So far, most attention has been on the Mediterranean Solar Plan or Desertec. An EU–Russia Renewable Energy Plan or RUSTEC – being based on onshore wind/biomass/hydro energy and on-land interconnection, rather than solar power and subsea lines – could present a cost-efficient and short-term complement to Desertec. This article examines the political, geopolitical, economic, social and legal challenges and opportunities of exporting “green” energy from Russia to the EU. It argues that EU–Russian cooperation in the renewable energy field would present a win-win situation: Member States could achieve their targets on the basis of Russia's renewable energy potential, while Russia could begin to develop a national renewable energy industry without risking potential price increases for domestic consumers—a concern of great political sensitivity in Russia."
478,Racial and Ethnic Disparities in the Outcomes of Elderly Home Care Recipients,A. Brega;G. Goodrich;M. Powell;J. Grigsby,Home Health Care Services Quarterly,"The purpose of this study was to examine racial/ethnic disparities in functional outcomes of elderly home health care recipients. Analyses were conducted using Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) data for a nationally representative sample of home health care episodes for patients aged 65 and older. Risk-adjusted regression analyses examined the association between race/ethnicity and functional outcomes. Fourteen outcome measures reflected improvement in specific functional areas (e.g., ambulation) and two reflected overall functional change. Non-Hispanic Whites (“Whites”) experienced substantially better functional outcomes than did home health care recipients of other racial/ethnic backgrounds. The disparity in outcomes was most pronounced between Whites and African Americans."
479,Radiation protection for surgeons and anesthetists: practices and knowledge before and after training,A. Brun;R. Mor;M. Bourrelly;G. Dalivoust;G. Gazazian;R. Boufercha;M. Lehucher-Michel;I. Sari-Minodier,Journal of Radiological Protection,"The use of radiological activity in the operating room (OR) and a regulatory decrease of the eye lens dose warrant an assessment of how medical staff are protected from radiation. This study aims to evaluate practices and knowledge in radiation protection (RP) for OR doctors before and after training. A descriptive study of surgeons and anesthetists in a French public hospital center was conducted in 2016. An ad hoc questionnaire concerning occupational practices and knowledge about RP was distributed before and one month after RP training. Among 103 doctors attending the training, 90 answered the questionnaire before the training. Results showed a lack of knowledge and good practice in RP. Most of the participants (86.7%) had never been trained in RP and recognized insufficient knowledge. Most of them (92.2%) wore a lead apron, 50.0% a thyroid-shield, 5.6% lead glasses, 53.3% a passive dosimeter and 17.8% an electronic dosimeter. None of them benefitted from collective protective equipment such as a ceiling suspended screen. The questionnaire following the training was completed by only 35 doctors. A comparison before and after training results showed an improvement in knowledge (scores of correct responses: 5.5/16 before and 9.5/16 after training) but not in RP good practices (scores of correct responses: 3.2/7 before and 3.3/7 after training). One training session appears to be insufficient to improve the application of the safety rules when x-rays are used. Communication needs to be improved regarding RP among anesthetists and surgeons, such as training renewal, workstation analysis in OR related to x-ray use and occupational medical follow-up. Otherwise, radiological risks in OR need to be given better consideration, such as radio-induced cataract risk. It is necessary to encourage the use of dosimeters and protective equipment and to strengthen access to lead glasses and collective protective equipment, such as ceiling suspended screens. All these recommendations ensure the received dose is reduced to as low as is reasonably achievable."
480,Radio emission from shell-type supernova remnants,A. Asvarov,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"The evolution of the radio emission of shell-type Supernova remnants (SNRs) is modeled within the framework of the simple and commonly used assumptions that the mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is responsible for generating radio emitting electrons and that the magnetic field is the typical interstellar field compressed at the shock. It is considered that electrons are injected into the mechanism in test-particle regime directly from the high energy tail of the downstream Maxwellian distribution function. The model can be applied to most of the observed SNRs because the majority of detected SNRs are shell-types and have a more or less spherical shape and are sources of nonthermal radio emission. It is shown that the model successfully explains the many averaged observational properties of evolved shell-type SNRs. In particular, the radio surface brightness (Σ) evolves with diameter as , while the bounding shock is strong (Mach number is ), followed by steep decrease (steeper than ) for . Such evolution of the surface brightness with diameter and its strong dependence on the environmental parameters strongly reduce the usefulness of relations as a tool for determining the distances to SNRs. The model predicts no radio emission from SNRs in the late radiative stage of evolution and the existence of radio-quiet but relatively active SNRs is possible. Our model easily explains very large-diameter radio sources such as the Galactic Loops and the candidates for Hypernova radio remnants. The model predicts that most of the observed SNRs with are located in a tenuous phase of the ISM. The model also predicts the existence of a population of pc SNRs with if the kinetic energy of the explosion is erg. From the comparison of the model results with the statistics of evolved shell-type SNRs, we were able to estimate the fraction of electrons accelerated from the thermal pool in the range . If acceleration takes place directly from the high energy tail of the downstream Maxwellian distribution function, then the corresponding injection momentum is estimated as ."
481,Raman and IR studies of the effect of Fe substitution in hydroxyapatites and deuterated hydroxyapatite,A. Antonakos;E. Liarokapis;A. Kyriacou;T. Leventouri,American Mineralogist,"We have studied synthetic Fe-substituted hydroxyapatite CaFe(PO)OH and the corresponding deuterated samples with varying Fe concentrations (0 ≤ ≤ 0.3) by Raman and IR spectroscopy at room temperature. In the IR spectra, substitution of deuterons for protons affects the OH internal mode in a way consistent with the mass difference of the substituting ions, as well as a mode attributed to vibrations of the Ca-(OH) unit. In the Raman spectra, the frequency of all modes is not noticeably affected by the Fe substitution. Raman bands show increased width and substantial reduction in intensity with increasing amount of Fe, presumably related to disorder introduced by the substitution. We find that the disorder is smaller in the hydroxyapatites compared to the deuterated ones."
482,Random Machines: A bagged-weighted support vector model with free kernel choice,A. Ara;M. Maia;S. Macêdo;F. Louzada,ArXiv Computer Science,"Improvement of statistical learning models in order to increase efficiency in solving classification or regression problems is still a goal pursued by the scientific community. In this way, the support vector machine model is one of the most successful and powerful algorithms for those tasks. However, its performance depends directly from the choice of the kernel function and their hyperparameters. The traditional choice of them, actually, can be computationally expensive to do the kernel choice and the tuning processes. In this article, it is proposed a novel framework to deal with the kernel function selection called Random Machines. The results improved accuracy and reduced computational time. The data study was performed in simulated data and over 27 real benchmarking datasets."

484,Re-Os and HSE in individual base metal sulfide grains: Evaluating micro-analytical procedures using a sulfide reference material,A. Bragagni;D. Acken;R. Fonseca;I. Speelmanns;A. Luguet,Chemical Geology,"Two Fe-Ni sulfides, resembling the chemical composition of a typical mantle base metal sulfide (BMS), were synthesized and used to test micro-analytical procedures (sample digestion and chemical separation) to determine 187Os/188Os and highly siderophile element (HSE) mass fractions in single BMS grains. The bulk 187Os/188Os and HSE mass fractions of the synthetic sulfides were independently determined after high pressure asher (HPA) digestion and conventional HSE separation (Os solvent extraction and Ir, Ru, Pt, Pd, Re separation via anion exchange chromatography), while the homogenous distribution of HSE was assessed via LA-ICP-MS.Tests were performed following the protocol of Pearson et al. (1998), where sulfides are digested in H2SO4/CrO3 and Os is simultaneously extracted as OsO4. Additional tests were performed adding a pre-digestion step in HBr and/or HCl. The duration and the temperature of the pre-digestion and micro-distillation steps, as well as different chromatographic separations of the HSE were also evaluated. While the majority of the tests yielded 187Os/188Os in agreement with that obtained after HPA digestion, HSE mass fractions show large deviations from the reference content, depending on the used procedure. Such variations are interpreted as the result of incomplete sulfide digestion, Os spike loss, and the possible presence of undigested sub-micrometric platinum group minerals (PGM). Overall, the bulk sulfide HSE mass fractions obtained after HPA digestion are best reproduced (mean deviations ≤10%) using a pre-digestion step in HBr + HCl at 120 °C.This study highlights the need for matrix-matched sulfide reference materials for routine use in laboratories determining HSE mass fractions and Os isotope ratios on single BMS grains. Such an approach is fundamental for comparing and compiling Re-Os ages collected on BMS in many different laboratories. This study also demonstrates that there is need for further testing and for methodological developments/improvement of the analytical procedure(s) used for Re-Os dating and HSE mass fraction determinations in single BMS grains."

486,Reading a water menu: Bottled water and the cultivation of taste,A. Biro,Journal of Consumer Culture,"The market for bottled water is growing and increasingly segmented. How do we explain not just the willingness to pay for a substance (water) that is almost free but also the increasing discernment in a drink generally considered tasteless? We argue that bottled water market segmentation is a leading edge of processes of water commodification, associated with the crisis of Fordism and rise of consumerist capitalism, where the assertion of status through commodity consumption is increasingly necessary. The extensive Ray’s & Stark water menu is analyzed to show how the taste for bottled waters is cultivated. In the menu, references to gustatory sensation are limited. Instead, the tastefulness of water inheres in the distance from anthropogenic influence, made visible through scientific (geological) discourses. The tension between the desire to consume unmediated nature and the scientific abstraction necessary to recognize it reveals the social character of the taste for bottled waters. The highly refined sense of taste that the water menu’s readers are presumed to have is a reflection of consumerist capitalism’s distinctive ways of reproducing socio-economic inequality and metabolizing non-human nature."
487,Real-time Quadrifocal Visual Odometry,A. Comport;E. Malis;P. Rives,International Journal of Robotics Research,In this paper we describe a new image-based approach to tracking the six-degree-of-freedom trajectory of a stereo camera pair. The proposed technique estimates the pose and subsequently the dense pixel matching between temporal image pairs in a sequence by performing dense spatial matching between images of a stereo reference pair. In this way a minimization approach is employed which directly uses all grayscale information available within the stereo pair (or stereo region) leading to very robust and precise results. Metric 3D structure constraints are imposed by consistently warping corresponding stereo images to generate novel viewpoints at each stereo acquisition. An iterative non-linear trajectory estimation approach is formulated based on a quadrifocal relationship between the image intensities within adjacent views of the stereo pair. A robust M-estimation technique is used to reject outliers corresponding to moving objects within the scene or other outliers such as occlusions and illumination changes. The technique is applied to recovering the trajectory of a moving vehicle in long and difficult sequences of images.
488,Real-time Secure Health Surveillance for Smarter Health Communities,A. Alabdulatif;I. Khalil;A. Forkan;M. Atiquzzaman,IEEE Communications Magazine,"Pervasive healthcare services with smart decision making capability and ubiquitous communication technologies can forge future smart communities. Real-time health surveillance for early detection of life-threatening diseases through advanced sensing and communication technology can provide better treatment, reduce medical expenses and save lives of community residents (i.e., patients). However, the assurance of data privacy is the prime concern for such smart health technologies. This research aims to describe a privacy-preserving cloud-based system for real-time health surveillance through change detection of multiple vital health signs of smart community members. Vital signs data generated from IoT-enabled wearable devices are processed in real-time in a cloud environment. This article focuses on the development of a predictive model for the smart community considering the sensitivity of data processing in a third-party environment (e.g., cloud computing). We developed a vital sign change detection system using Holt's linear trend method (to enable prediction of data with trends) where fully homomorphic encryption is adapted to perform computations on an encrypted domain that can ensure data privacy. Moreover, to reduce the overhead of the fully homomorphic encryption method over large medical data we introduced a parallel approach for encrypted computations using a MapReduce algorithm of Apache Hadoop. We demonstrated the proposed model by evaluating some case studies for different vital signs of patients. The accuracy and efficiency of the implementation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for building a smart community."
489,Real-time markerless tracking for augmented reality: the virtual visual servoing framework,A. Comport;E. Marchand;M. Pressigout;F. Chaumette,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,"Tracking is a very important research subject in a real-time augmented reality context. The main requirements for trackers are high accuracy and little latency at a reasonable cost. In order to address these issues, a real-time, robust, and efficient 3D model-based tracking algorithm is proposed for a ""video see through"" monocular vision system. The tracking of objects in the scene amounts to calculating the pose between the camera and the objects. Virtual objects can then be projected into the scene using the pose. In this paper, nonlinear pose estimation is formulated by means of a virtual visual servoing approach. In this context, the derivation of point-to-curves interaction matrices are given for different 3D geometrical primitives including straight lines, circles, cylinders, and spheres. A local moving edges tracker is used in order to provide real-time tracking of points normal to the object contours. Robustness is obtained by integrating an M-estimator into the visual control law via an iteratively reweighted least squares implementation. This approach is then extended to address the 3D model-free augmented reality problem. The method presented in this paper has been validated on several complex image sequences including outdoor environments. Results show the method to be robust to occlusion, changes in illumination, and mistracking."
490,Realizing Uncertainty-Aware Timing Stack in Embedded Operating System,A. Alanwar;F. Anwar;J. Hespanha;M. Srivastava,ArXiv Computer Science,"Time awareness is critical to a broad range of emerging applications -- in Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet of Things -- running on commodity platforms and operating systems. Traditionally, time is synchronized across devices through a best-effort background service whose performance is neither observable nor controllable, thus consuming system resources independently of application needs while not allowing the applications and OS services to adapt to changes in uncertainty in system time. We advocate for rethinking how time is managed in a system stack. In this paper, we propose a new clock model that characterizes various sources of timing uncertainties in true time. We then present a Kalman filter based time synchronization protocol that adapts to the uncertainties exposed by the clock model. Our realization of a uncertainty-aware clock model and synchronization protocol is based on a standard embedded Linux platform."

For that purpose we estimate a fixed effects panel data model of 15 major Indian states over the years 1992–2009. Our results show that urbanization and crimes against women increase suicide rates, regardless of gender. Literacy and gross enrolment decrease suicide rates for women but have exactly the opposite effect for men while poverty has a general negative effect on both male and female suicide rates. Unemployment is observed to be not affecting the suicide rate. Adequate explanations for these impacts are provided and policy implications drawn."

Strugarek,Space Science Reviews,"We discuss recent observational, theoretical and numerical progress made in understanding the solar global magnetism and its short and long term variability. We discuss the physical process thought to be at the origin of the solar magnetic field and its 22-yr cycle, namely dynamo action, and the nonlinear interplay between convection, rotation, radiation and magnetic field, yielding modulations of the solar constant or of the large scale flows such as the torsional oscillations. We also discuss the role of the field parity and dynamo families in explaining the complex multipolar structure of the solar global magnetic field. We then present some key MHD processes acting in the deep radiative interior and discuss the probable topology of a primordial field there. Finally we summarize how helioseismology has contributed to these recent advances and how it could contribute to resolving current unsolved problems in solar global dynamics and magnetism."
493,"Recent Developments in the Scope, Practicality, and Mechanistic Understanding of Enantioselective Hydroformylation",A. Brezny;C. Landis,Accounts of Chemical Research,"In the nearly 80 years since catalytic hydroformylation was first reported, hundreds of billions of pounds of aldehyde have been produced by this atom efficient one-carbon homologation of alkenes in the presence of H2 and CO. Despite the economy and demonstrated scalability of hydroformylation, the enantioselective process (asymmetric hydroformylation, AHF) currently does not contribute significantly to the production of chiral aldehydes and their derivatives. Current impediments to practical application of AHF include low diversity of chiral ligands that provide effective rates and selectivities, limited exploration of substrate scope, few demonstrations of efficient flow reactor processes, and incomplete mechanistic understanding of the factors that control reaction selectivity and rate. This Account summarizes developments in ligand design, substrate scope, reactor technology, and mechanistic understanding that advance AHF toward practical and atom-efficient production of chiral α-stereogenic aldehydes.Initial applications of AHF were limited to activated terminal alkenes such as styrene, but recent developments enable high selectivity for unactivated olefins and more complex substrates such as 1,1′- and 1,2-disubstituted alkenes. Expanded substrate scope primarily results from new chiral phosphine ligands, especially phospholanes and bisdiazaphospholanes (BDPs). These ligands are now more accessible due to improved synthesis and resolution procedures. One of the virtues of diazaphospholanes is the relative ease of derivatization, including attachment to heterogeneous supports. Hydroformylation involves toxic and flammable reactants, a serious concern in pharmaceutical production facilities. Flow reactors offer many process benefits for handling dangerous reagents and for systematically moving from research to production scales. New approaches to achieving good gas–liquid mixing in flow reactors have been demonstrated with BDP-derived catalyst systems and lend assurance that AHF can be practically implemented by the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries.To date, progress in AHF has been empirically driven, because hydroformylation is a complex, multistep process for which the origins of chemo-, regio-, and enantioselectivity are difficult to elucidate. Mechanistic complexity arises from three concurrent catalytic cycles (linear and two diastereomeric branched paths), significant pooling of catalyst as off-cycle species, and multiple elementary steps that are kinetically competitive. Addressing such complexity requires new approaches to collecting kinetic and extra-kinetic information and analyzing these data. In this Account, we describe our group’s progress toward understanding the complex kinetics and mechanism of AHF as catalyzed by rhodium bis(diazaphospholane) catalysts. Our strategy features both “outside-in” (i.e., monitoring catalytic rates and selectivities as a function of reactant concentration and temperature) and “inside-out” (i.e., building kinetic models based on the rates of component steps of the catalytic reaction) approaches. These studies include isotopic labeling, interception and characterization of catalytic intermediates using NMR techniques, multinuclear high-pressure NMR spectroscopy, and sophisticated kinetic modeling. Such broad-based approaches illuminate the kinetic and mechanistic origins of selectivity and activity of AHF and the elucidation of important principles that apply to all catalytic reactions."
494,Receptors Mediating Endothelin-1-Induced Contractions of Rabbit Gallbladder,A. Cardozo;J. Koepp;P. D'Orléans-Juste;G. Rae,Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology,"Summary: We have examined the responsiveness of strips of rabbit gallbladder (RGB) to endothelin (ET) receptor agonists, and its susceptibility to blockade by selective antagonists. Endothelin-1 (ET-1; 0.1-100.0 nM) caused graded tonic contractions with a CK50 (concentration causing response equivalent to 50% of KC1 80 mM) of 3.4 nM and EH (response to highest concentration) of 186 ± 22, being 40-fold less potent than cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8), 103-fold more potent than carbachol, but equipotent to ET-3, sarafotoxin S6c (S6c) and IRL 1620. The selective ETA receptor antagonists BQ-123 (3 μM) and A-127722-5 (0.3 μM) did not block responses to ET-1, but BQ-123 depressed responses to 30-100 nM ET-3 by about 35%. The ETB receptor antagonist BQ-788 (1 μM) shifted the curve to S6c by only fivefold. In rabbit aorta and at these same concentrations, BQ-123 and A-127722-5 markedly shifted (≥ 100-fold) the curve for ET-1-induced contraction , whereas BQ-788 shifted that for S6c 40-fold. Higher concentrations of all three antagonists contracted the RGB. Thus, although RGB responses to ETs and selective ETB receptor agonists seem to be largely mediated via ETB receptors, they are remarkably insensitive to blockade by both selective ETA and ETB receptor antagonists, as previously reported in the guinea pig gallbladder . Finally, through yet unknown mechanisms, high concentrations of ET receptor antagonists induce marked RGB contractions. It remains to be seen whether this finding is predictive of adverse biliary tract side-effects of such drugs in the clinic.

Jaroudi;F. Binhumaid;B. Meyer;S. Arold;D. Monies,Human Genomics,"Background Most mitochondrial and cytoplasmic aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are encoded by nuclear genes. Syndromic disorders resulting from mutation of aaRSs genes display significant phenotypic heterogeneity. We expand aaRSs-related phenotypes through characterization of the clinical and molecular basis of a novel autosomal-recessive syndrome manifesting severe mental retardation, ataxia, speech impairment, epilepsy, short stature, microcephaly, hypogonadism, and growth hormone deficiency. Results A G>A variant in exon 29 of VARS2 (c.3650G>A) (NM_006295) was identified in the index case. This homozygous variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and segregated with disease in the family studied. The c.3650G>A change results in alteration of arginine to histidine at residue 1217 (R1217H) of the mature protein and is predicted to be pathogenic. Conclusions These findings contribute to a growing list of aaRSs disorders, broadens the spectrum of phenotypes attributable to VARS2 mutations, and provides new insight into genotype-phenotype correlations among the mitochondrial synthetase genes."
496,Reconstructing the early 19th‐century Waal River by means of a 2D physics‐based numerical model,A. Arboleda;A. Crosato;H. Middelkoop,Hydrological Processes,"Suspended‐sediment concentration data are a missing link in reconstructions of the River Waal in the early 1800s. These reconstructions serve as a basis for assessing the long‐term effects of major interventions carried out between 1850 AD and the early 20th century. We used a 2D physics‐based morphodynamic model accounting for the influence of floodplain vegetation to fill in this gap. Historical discharge hydrographs were derived from a correlation between flow discharge records at Cologne and water level measurements of the Rhine branches in the Netherlands, taking into account the discharge distribution between the branches. Historical floodplain sedimentation rates were estimated using old cartographic information and recent geomorphologic field work. The computed historical sedimentation rates are found to be within the range of measured data, which suggests that fine suspended sediment concentrations in the early 1800s were comparable to contemporary ones. The computations show also how vegetation enhances the formation of natural levees close to the main channel and at the same time decreases the sedimentation rates in farther areas of the floodplain. A sensitivity analysis shows suspended sediment composition to have a strong influence on the resulting quantities and patterns of floodplain deposition. The reconstruction has also provided validation of the modelling tools to reproduce the effects of vegetation on sediment dynamics, enabling their implementation to study other cases.

497,Recovery of gold from gold slag by wood shaving fly ash,A. Aworn;P. Thiravetyan;W. Nakbanpote,Journal of Colloid and Interface Science,"Wood shaving fly ash was used as an alternative adsorbent for gold preconcentration from gold slag. The maximum gold adsorption capacity of wood shaving fly ash washed with tap water (WSFW) at 20, 30, 40, and 60 °C was 8.68, 7.79, 7.44, and 7.25 mgAu/gadsorbent, respectively, while of activated carbon it was 76.78, 60.95, 56.13, and 51.90 mgAu/gadsorbent, respectively. Deionized water at 100 °C could elute gold adsorbed onto WSFW to 71%. The effect of the increasing temperature of water, 30, 60, and 100 °C, implied that the adsorption mechanism was mainly physical adsorption. The negative values of enthalpy change (ΔH) and free energy change (ΔG) indicated an exothermic and spontaneous process, respectively. The positive values of entropy change (ΔS) indicated increasing disorder of the system. The advantages of wood shaving fly ash are the purification of gold and the easier recycling of gold from the gold-adsorbed adsorbent.Wood shaving fly ash was used as an alternative adsorbent for gold preconcentration from gold slag.

498,Recycling Perovskite Solar Cells To Avoid Lead Waste,A. Binek;M. Petrus;N. Huber;H. Bristow;Y. Hu;T. Bein;P. Docampo,ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces,"Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite based solar cells have recently emerged as a serious competitor for large scale and low-cost photovoltaic technologies. However, since these solar cells contain toxic lead, a sustainable procedure for handling the cells after their operational lifetime is required to prevent exposure of the environment to lead and to comply with international electronic waste disposal regulations. Herein, we report a procedure to remove every layer of the solar cells separately, which gives the possibility to selectively isolate the different materials. Besides isolating the toxic lead iodide in high yield, we show that the PbI2 can be reused for the preparation of new solar cells with comparable performance and in this way avoid lead waste. Furthermore, we show that the most expensive part of the solar cell, the conductive glass (FTO), can be reused several times without any reduction in the performance of the devices. With our simple recycling procedure, we address both the risk of contamination and the waste disposal of perovskite based solar cells while further reducing the cost of the system. This brings perovskite solar cells one step closer to their introduction into commercial systems."
499,Recycling of crystal mush-derived melts and short magma residence times revealed by U-series disequilibria at Stromboli volcano,A. Bragagni;R. Avanzinelli;H. Freymuth;L. Francalanci,Earth and Planetary Science Letters,"The presence of crystal mushes in the feeding system of active volcanoes is generally revealed by antecrysts, representing the crystalline portion of old magmas recycled in the juvenile material, but very little is known about the fate of interstitial liquid hosted within the crystal-rich mush (i.e. antemelt). U-series disequilibria measured in magmas erupted in the past 18 years at Stromboli volcano provide the first geochemical evidence of the involvement of antemelt and help constraining the timescales of the processes occurring in the plumbing system of the volcano. Despite almost constant major and trace element composition, significant variations in isotope ratios are observed. (230Th/232Th) decreases with time, whilst (238U/232Th), (226Ra/230Th) and 87Sr/86Sr are different in the two types of magma erupted. Magma with low phenocryst content (lp) is erupted as pumices during paroxysm and is thought to belong to a deep reservoir. Highly porphyritic magma (hp) is erupted during the normal “Strombolian” activity as scoria and during the effusive events as lavas, and it is considered to derive from the former one within a shallow reservoir through degassing-driven crystallisation, mixing and incorporation of antecrysts. The distinct (238U/232Th) of lp and hp magma requires the involvement of a component with high 87Sr/86Sr and (238U/232Th) deriving from older magmas erupted earlier in the volcano history (up to 2.5 ka). The incompatibility of U and Th in major mineral phases limits the possible effect of antecrysts, hence requiring the involvement of a U- and Th-rich antemelt. The decrease of 226Ra-excess from lp to hp magmas provides further and independent evidence for the involvement of a few thousands years old antemelt.The variation with time of (230Th/232Th) within lp and hp magmas is exploited to constrain the residence time of magmas in the deep and shallow reservoir of the volcano to &lt;55yrs (inferred reservoir volume &lt;0.5km3) and 2–10 yrs (inferred reservoir volume 0.02–0.09km3), respectively. Our results show the occurrence of magmatic processes operating at different timescale within the feeding system of a so-called steady state volcano, such as Stromboli. We show that, while most of the magma is erupted within few years, a portion of it, made of both crystals (antecrysts) and residual liquid (antemelt), can be stored in the plumbing system for thousands of years to be eventually rejuvenated and mixed back into the shallow reservoir. The presence of antemelts may also affect the eruptive mechanism by promoting heat transfer in locked crystal mushes, hence favouring their remobilisation.U-series at Stromboli reveals recycling of ∼2ka interstitial melts (antemelts).We provide the fist geochemical evidences of recycled antemelt from crystal mush.Antemelts may provide a new interpretation for U-series in volcanic systems.Estimated residence times of magma are shorter than few tens of years.Thus, processes at different timescales operates within the same magmatic system.The presence of crystal mushes in the feeding system of active volcanoes is generally revealed by antecrysts, representing the crystalline portion of old magmas recycled in the juvenile material, but very little is known about the fate of interstitial liquid hosted within the crystal-rich mush (i.e. antemelt).

500,Reducing Stereotype Threat With Embodied Triggers: A Case of Sensorimotor–Mental Congruence,A. Chalabaev;R. Radel;E. Masicampo;V. Dru,Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,"In four experiments, we tested whether embodied triggers may reduce stereotype threat. We predicted that left-side sensorimotor inductions would increase cognitive performance under stereotype threat, because such inductions are linked to avoidance motivation among right-handers. This sensorimotor–mental congruence hypothesis rests on regulatory fit research showing that stereotype threat may be reduced by avoidance-oriented interventions, and motor congruence research showing positive effects when two parameters of a motor action activate the same motivational system (avoidance or approach). Results indicated that under stereotype threat, cognitive performance was higher when participants contracted their left hand (Study 1) or when the stimuli were presented on the left side of the visual field (Studies 2-4), as compared with right-hand contraction or right-side visual stimulation. These results were observed on math (Studies 1, 2, and 4) and Stroop (Study 3) performance. An indirect effect of congruence on math performance through subjective fluency was also observed."
501,Reducing conditions differentially affect the functional and structural properties of group-I and -II metabotropic glutamate receptors,A. Copani;C. Romano;V. Gerevini;A. Nicosia;F. Nicoletti,Brain Research,"We have examined the influence of reducing conditions on the activity of group-I or -II metabotropic glutamate receptors. In cultured cerebellar granule cells or in hippocampal slices, the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) inhibited the stimulation of polyphosphoinositide (PPI) hydrolysis elicited by group-I mGlu receptor agonists without affecting responses to norepinephrine or carbamylcholine. Similarly, DTT reduced the increase in intracellular free Ca2+ induced by glutamate in HEK-293 cells expressing mGlu5 receptors. In adult hippocampal slices, the selective group-II mGlu receptor agonist, (2S,1′R,2′R,3′R)-2-(2,3-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG-IV) had no effect per se on PPI hydrolysis, but potentiated the response to quisqualate. Although DTT substantially attenuated the action of quisqualate, it did not affect the potentiation by DCG-IV, suggesting that group-II mGlu receptors are resistant to extracellular reduction. Accordingly, DTT did not affect the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation induced by maximally effective concentrations of group-II mGlu receptor agonists in hippocampal slices or in CHO cells expressing mGlu2 receptors. At structural level, DTT differentially affected the aggregation state of mGlu1a, -2/3 or -5 receptors. In immunoblots performed under non-reducing conditions, mGlu1a, -2/3 or -5 antibodies labeled exclusively a high-molecular weight band, corresponding to receptor dimers. Under reducing conditions, mGlu1a or -5 receptors were detected as monomers, whereas a large proportion of mGlu2/3 receptors was still present in a dimeric form. We conclude that reducing conditions differentially influence the aggregation state of group-I and -II mGlu receptors and suggest that dimerization affects the functional activity of native mGlu receptors.We have examined the influence of reducing conditions on the activity of group-I or -II metabotropic glutamate receptors.

Piles,Inorganic Chemistry,"MoVI(S2C6H4)3 reacts cleanly and completely with H2O in THF to afford [H3O]+[MoV(S2C6H4)3]-. Kinetic data were fit by the rate equation −d[MoVI(S2C6H4)3]/dt = k[MoVI(S2C6H4)3]/[H3O+], which is consistent with a coupled electron−proton transfer mechanism involving a coordinated H2O molecule. The MoVI(S2C6H4)3 reduction is accelerated by the presence of PPh3 and affords OPPh3. 18O isotope tracing shows that H2O is the source of oxygen transferred to PPh3."
503,Reduction of soil contamination by cypermethrin residues using phytoremediation with Plantago major and some surfactants,A. Aioub;Y. Li;X. Qie;X. Zhang;Z. Hu,Environmental Sciences Europe,"Background Surfactant-enhanced phytoremediation is an eco-friendly treatment for reducing soil contamination. Cypermethrin (CYP) is one of the most widely used pyrethroid insecticides against different pests, and its use causes soil contamination. The aim of this study was to investigate the removal of CYP from contaminated soil by Plantago major (PM) and some surfactants. For the first time, we documented the uptake and translocation of CYP from the soil and used some strategies to improve the effectiveness of this technology, which involved the use of various surfactants to solubilize the contaminant. In a pot experiment, four surfactants [liquid silicon dioxide (SiO 2 , 750 mg L −1 ), 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPßCD, 1%), humic acid (HA, 10 mg L −1 ) and Tween 80 (Tw80, 9.2 mg L −1 )] were used to facilitate the phytoremediation of CYP (10 µg g −1 )-contaminated soil by PM. Results Our data showed that amending the soil with PM plus SiO 2 significantly reduced the amount of CYP in the soil and highly increased the concentrations of CYP in the plant roots and leaves. The longest half-life value ( t 1/2 ) of CYP was in the sterilized soil treatment (24.8 days), and the shortest was in the soil with PM amended with SiO 2 (6.41 days). The half-life value ( t 1/2 ) of CYP in soil with PM alone was 10.0 days. Through in vitro experiments, a batch equilibrium technique showed that hydroxypropyl-ß-cyclodextrin (HPßCD) is the best surfactant to most efficiently eliminate CYP from the soil. However, in the greenhouse experiment, the addition of SiO 2 to soil cultivated with PM was more effective than the use of other solubility-enhancing surfactants in the removal of significant amounts of CYP ( p > 0.05) from the contaminated soil. Conclusions The integration of SiO 2 + PM is the best treatment and is recommended for minimizing plant contaminant contents in CYP-contaminated soil."
504,Reduction to a symmetric predicate,A. Cobham,Journal of Symbolic Logic,"It has been shown by Quine that an interpreted theory Θ, formulated in the notation of quantification theory, is translatable into a theory Θ′ in which the only primitive predicate is a dyadic F. In establishing this result Quine takes for the universe of Θ′ a set which comprehends the universe of Θ and has the property that if x and y are members then so is {x, y}. For this fragmentary set theory the distinctness of x from {x, y} and {{x}} is assumed. It will be shown here that, if a pair of somewhat more stringent restrictions are assumed for the set theory, then there is a symmetric dyadic predicate G definable within Θ′, i.e., in terms of F alone, in terms of which F is in turn definable. It follows from this extended result that the theory Θ is translatable into a theory in which the only primitive predicate is symmetric and dyadic."
505,Reductions in aircraft particulate emissions due to the use of Fischer–Tropsch fuels,A. Beyersdorf;M. Timko;L. Ziemba;D. Bulzan;E. Corporan;S. Herndon;R. Howard;R. Miake-Lye;K. Thornhill;E. Winstead;C. Wey;Z. Yu;B. Anderson,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,"The use of alternative fuels for aviation is likely to increase due to concerns over fuel security, price stability, and the sustainability of fuel sources. Concurrent reductions in particulate emissions from these alternative fuels are expected because of changes in fuel composition including reduced sulfur and aromatic content. The NASA Alternative Aviation Fuel Experiment (AAFEX) was conducted in January–February 2009 to investigate the effects of synthetic fuels on gas-phase and particulate emissions. Standard petroleum JP-8 fuel, pure synthetic fuels produced from natural gas and coal feedstocks using the Fischer–Tropsch (FT) process, and 50% blends of both fuels were tested in the CFM-56 engines on a DC-8 aircraft. To examine plume chemistry and particle evolution with time, samples were drawn from inlet probes positioned 1, 30, and 145 m downstream of the aircraft engines. No significant alteration to engine performance was measured when burning the alternative fuels. However, leaks in the aircraft fuel system were detected when operated with the pure FT fuels as a result of the absence of aromatic compounds in the fuel. Dramatic reductions in soot emissions were measured for both the pure FT fuels (reductions in mass of 86% averaged over all powers) and blended fuels (66%) relative to the JP-8 baseline with the largest reductions at idle conditions. At 7% power, this corresponds to a reduction from 7.6 mg kg−1 for JP-8 to 1.2 mg kg−1 for the natural gas FT fuel. At full power, soot emissions were reduced from 103 to 24 mg kg−1 (JP-8 and natural gas FT, respectively). The alternative fuels also produced smaller soot (e.g., at 85% power, volume mean diameters were reduced from 78 nm for JP-8 to 51 nm for the natural gas FT fuel), which may reduce their ability to act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The reductions in particulate emissions are expected for all alternative fuels with similar reductions in fuel sulfur and aromatic content regardless of the feedstock. As the plume cools downwind of the engine, nucleation-mode aerosols form. For the pure FT fuels, reductions (94% averaged over all powers) in downwind particle number emissions were similar to those measured at the exhaust plane (84%). However, the blended fuels had less of a reduction (reductions of 30–44%) than initially measured (64%). The likely explanation is that the reduced soot emissions in the blended fuel exhaust plume results in promotion of new particle formation microphysics, rather than coating on pre-existing soot particles, which is dominant in the JP-8 exhaust plume. Downwind particle volume emissions were reduced for both the pure (79 and 86% reductions) and blended FT fuels (36 and 46%) due to the large reductions in soot emissions. In addition, the alternative fuels had reduced particulate sulfate production (near zero for FT fuels) due to decreased fuel sulfur content. To study the formation of volatile aerosols (defined as any aerosol formed as the plume ages) in more detail, tests were performed at varying ambient temperatures (−4 to 20 °C). At idle, particle number and volume emissions were reduced linearly with increasing ambient temperature, with best fit slopes corresponding to −8 × 1014 particles (kg fuel)−1 °C−1 for particle number emissions and −10 mm3 (kg fuel)−1 °C−1 for particle volume emissions. The temperature dependency of aerosol formation can have large effects on local air quality surrounding airports in cold regions. Aircraft-produced aerosols in these regions will be much larger than levels expected based solely on measurements made directly at the engine exit plane. The majority (90% at idle) of the volatile aerosol mass formed as nucleation-mode aerosols, with a smaller fraction as a soot coating. Conversion efficiencies of up to 2.8% were measured for the partitioning of gas-phase precursors (unburned hydrocarbons and SO2) to form volatile aerosols. Highest conversion efficiencies were measured at 45% power."
506,Reflective Sociocultural Psychology: Lost and Found in Collaboration with Funding Agencies and ICT Experts,A. Baucal,Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science,"This paper deals with emerging kinds of collaboration between researchers, funding agencies and ICT (Information and Communications Technology) experts. The goal of this paper is to analyze the challenges and opportunities for researchers presented by such collaborations. The analysis is based on a sociocultural approach, and leads to the following conclusions: (a) the main challenges to collaboration arise from the fact that partners’ communities have different goals and use different sets of mediation tools, (b) there are different ways for researchers to cope with more powerful partners such as major funding agencies (refusing collaboration, pseudo collaboration, asymmetric collaboration, and real partnership), (c) appropriation of mediation tools developed by partners could be useful for researchers, (d) collaboration with partners could be a source of new theoretically interesting phenomenon, and (e) communication with partners who are not familiar with our routine discourses might help us to improve our own understanding."
507,Regional state capacity and the optimal degree of fiscal decentralization,A. Bellofatto;M. Besfamille,Journal of Public Economics,"We study the optimal degree of fiscal decentralization in a federation. Regional governments are characterized by their abilities to deliver public goods (administrative capacity) and to raise tax revenues (fiscal capacity). Two regimes are compared on efficiency grounds. Under partial decentralization, regional governments rely on central bailouts to complete local projects in financing needs. Under full decentralization, marginal financing is achieved via local capital taxes. We show that the presence of sufficiently low levels of administrative capacity is a necessary condition for full decentralization dominance. This condition may also be sufficient, depending on the projects' characteristics. Some extensions are presented."

Hultberg,Mechanisms of Ageing and Development,"Acid hydrolases and lysosomal membrane properties were studied at various ages in the normal human brain. In CSF and four brain regions, the inferior olive, the cerebrallar cortex, the caudate nucleus and the frontal cortex were thus β-galactosidase, β-glucosidase, α-mannosidase, hexosaminides and acid phosphatase biochemically quantitated at ages varying between 24 and 89 years of age. Also the membrane latency for acid phosphatase was studied in these regions.No major regional quantitative differences were found with regard to the enzymes studied. Their kinetic properties were also defined. There appeared to exist a regional and intra-areal variation in lysosomal membrane permeability.

509,Register oder randomisierte Studien,A. Böning,Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,"Einleitung Im Zeitalter der „evidenzbasierten Medizin“ (EBM) haben randomisierte Studien und Metaanalysen die höchsten Evidenzlevel, obwohl Sackett, der den Begriff „evidenzbasierte Medizin“ prägte, auch andere Aspekte der EBM nannte. Material und Methoden Randomisierte Studien, Register und Metaanalysen werden hinsichtlich ihrer Methodik und ihrer potenziellen Nachteile für die Erzeugung medizinischer Evidenz beleuchtet. Bestimmte Sachverhalte können nicht in randomisierten Studien geklärt werden. Evidenzbasierte Medizin sollte auf den einzelnen Patienten angewendet werden und benötigt eine patientenbezogene Aufklärung. Deswegen sind die Gedanken und Wünsche des Patienten ein wichtiger Teil der EBM. Ergebnisse Randomisierte Studien werden häufig an kleinen, sorgfältig ausgewählten Patientengruppen unter definierten Ein- und Ausschlusskriterien durchgeführt. Daher können die so entstandenen Ergebnisse nicht ohne Weiteres auf ein breites Patientenspektrum übertragen werden, sondern sind nur für einige Patientengruppen maßgebend. Metaanalysen basieren auf statistischen Berechnungen und Annahmen, sind aber nicht besser als die ihnen zugrunde liegenden Studien. Ein Problem von Metaanalysen ist, dass bei großen Patientenzahlen statistisch signifikante Differenzen berechnet werden, die möglicherweise ohne klinische Relevanz sind. Register werden häufig mit großen Patientenzahlen geführt und enthalten Primärdaten. Dies macht zwar die Generalisierbarkeit leichter, nicht aber Annahmen über bestimmte Patientengruppen, denn Register enthalten häufig heterogene Patientengruppen. Schlussfolgerung Alle Formen von Studien zur Erzeugung medizinischer Evidenz müssen sorgfältig und mit gesundem Menschenverstand geprüft werden. Introduction In the era of evidence-based medicine (EBM), randomized studies and meta-analyses have the highest level of evidence; however, Sackett, who coined the phrase “evidence-based medicine” also had other things in mind. Material and methods Randomized trials, registries, and meta-analyses are evaluated for their methodology and for potential flaws that could hinder the generation of medical evidence. Moreover, certain things cannot be studied in randomized trials. The EBM should be used for a single patient and therefore patient informed consent has to be obtained. Therefore, the patient’s thoughts and wishes are an important part of EBM. Results Randomized studies are usually carried out on small, carefully chosen patient groups with defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Therefore, they cannot always be generalized to a broad patient spectrum but can only be valid for certain patients. Meta-analyses are based on statistical calculations and assumptions but are not better than those studies they depend on. One problem is that generating meta-analyses with huge patient numbers means that statistically relevant differences can be calculated that are possibly clinically irrelevant. Registries are often filled with large patient numbers and include primary data. This makes generalization easier but not assumptions about certain subgroups of patients because registries often include heterogeneous patient groups. Conclusion All forms of studies for generating medical evidence have to be evaluated carefully and with healthy common sense."
510,Regulation of Cell Proliferation by Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 in Hyperoxia-Exposed Neonatal Rat Lung,A. Chetty;H. Nielsen,Molecular Genetics and Metabolism,"Hyperoxic exposure of the developing lung leads to characteristic peribronchial and mesenchymal fibroproliferative changes. We hypothesize that O2-induced changes in the neonatal lung are mediated by Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Lung explant cultures were prepared from 3-day-old neonatal rat pups and exposed to room air or 95% O2 for 72 h. Western blots and immunohistochemistry were used to determine if hyperoxia stimulated IGF-1 and IGF-1R, and to identify the cell types involved. Retinoic acid was used to learn if this would inhibit oxygen-induced cell proliferation. Hyperoxia induced a significant increase in thymidine incorporation (control, 54 ± 9; hyperoxia, 254 ± 24 dpm/nM DNA; mean ± SEM; N = 3; P &lt; 0.05). This was inhibited by 5 × 10−5 M RA (149 ± 18 dpm/nM DNA; P &lt; 0.05) and by anti-IGF-1 antibody (115 ± 25 dpm/nM DNA; P &lt; 0.05; N = 3). BrdU labeling in the mesenchymal cells was significantly increased in mesenchymal cells after exposure to oxygen (91% higher than the room air control) but not in epithelial cells. This increase was inhibited in the presence of retinoic acid. Western blots showed IGF-1 protein was increased after 72 h of O2 exposure compared to room air exposure (57 ± 7 compared to 32 ± 5 densitometric units; P &lt; 0.05; N = 3). The increase was inhibited when the cultures were exposed to 95% O2 in the presence of anti-IGF-1 antibody (28 ± 4; P &lt; 0.05; N = 3). IGF-1 protein decreased in the presence of retinoic acid after oxygen exposure but not in room air. Immunostaining of O2-exposed lung showed IGF-1 was most abundant in airway and alveolar epithelial cells. We conclude that hyperoxia increases cell proliferation by stimulating IGF-1 in the neonatal rat lung. Interaction of IGF-1 and IGF-1R is an important cell-cell communication mechanism in the developmental and repair processes of hyperoxic neonatal lung injury."
511,Regulation of the transcriptome by ER stress: non-canonical mechanisms and physiological consequences,A. Arensdorf;D. Diedrichs;T. Rutkowski,Frontiers in Genetics,"The mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR) is propagated by three ER-resident transmembrane proteins, each of which initiates a signaling cascade that ultimately culminates in production of a transcriptional activator. The UPR was originally characterized as a pathway for upregulating ER chaperones, and a comprehensive body of subsequent work has shown that protein synthesis, folding, oxidation, trafficking, and degradation are all transcriptionally enhanced by the UPR. However, the global reach of the UPR extends to genes involved in diverse physiological processes having seemingly little to do with ER protein folding, and this includes a substantial number of mRNAs that are suppressed by stress rather than stimulated. Through multiple non-canonical mechanisms emanating from each of the UPR pathways, the cell dynamically regulates transcription and mRNA degradation. Here we highlight these mechanisms and their increasingly appreciated impact on physiological processes."
512,Relationship between effortful motivation and neurocognition in schizophrenia,A. Bismark;M. Thomas;M. Tarasenko;A. Shiluk;G. Light,Schizophrenia Research,"Effortful motivation and reward valuation learning deficits are associated with negative symptoms and impaired cognition in schizophrenia (SZ) patients. Whereas clinical assessments of motivation and reward value typically rely upon clinician ratings or self-report scales, behavioral measures often confound these constructs. Simple reverse-translated behavioral tasks that independently quantify motivation and reward valuation—which could then be linked to cognition—may facilitate the development of pro-cognitive therapeutics by bridging the “preclinical-to-clinical” gap. This study determined whether novel behavioral measures of effortful motivation and reward valuation are associated with impaired cognition in SZ patients (n = 36). Patients completed the Progressive Ratio Breakpoint task (PRBT; physical effort motivation) and the Probabilistic Learning Task (PLT; reward learning/valuation) in conjunction with the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). SZ patients exhibited statistically significant deficits in global cognition and all individual MCCB subdomains. Significant correlations were observed between PRBT and MCCB global cognition (r = 0.52), speed of processing (r = 0.56) and attention vigilance (r = 0.48) subdomains, but not with PLT or clinical symptoms. Results indicate that effort and reward learning deficits are dissociable targets that can improve our understanding of cognitive impairments associated among patients with SZ. More importantly, the results support the long-standing notion that the measurement of cognitive impairments in SZ is highly linked to a willingness to expend effort. The availability of a PRBT designed for use in both rodents and humans could improve our understanding of the nature of cognitive impairments in neuropsychiatric disorders and accelerate the development of novel pro-cognitive therapeutics."
513,Relationships between subject matter characteristics and the structure and output of university departments.,A. Biglan,Journal of Applied Psychology,"Examined the social structure and output of university scholars in terms of the characteristics of their academic subject-matter. On the basis of an earlier multidimensional analysis by A. Biglan (see PA, Vol. 51:Issue 1), academic areas were clustered according to their concern with: a single paradigm (hard vs soft), application (pure vs applied), and life systems (life system vs nonlife system). Depending on the characteristics of their area, Ss were found to differ in the degree to which they were socially connected to others; their commitment to teaching, research, and service; the number of journal articles, monographs, and technical reports that they published; and the number of dissertations that they sponsored."
514,Relic neutralino densities and detection rates with nonuniversal gaugino masses,A. Birkedal-Hansen;B. Nelson,Physical Review D,"We extend previous analyses of the interplay between nonuniversalities in the gaugino mass sector and the thermal relic densities of LSP neutralinos, in particular to the case of moderate to large tanβ. We introduce a set of parameters that generalizes the standard unified scenario to cover the complete allowed parameter space in the gaugino mass sector. We discuss the physical significance of the cosmologically preferred degree of degeneracy between charginos and the LSP and study the effect this degree of degeneracy has on the prospects for direct detection of relic neutralinos in the next round of dark matter detection experiments. Last, we compare the fine-tuning required to achieve a satisfactory relic density with the case of universal gaugino masses, as in minimal supergravity, and find it to be of a similar magnitude. The sensitivity of quantifiable measures of fine-tuning on such factors as the gluino mass and top and bottom masses is also examined."
515,Religion as Dialogical Resource: A Socio-cultural Approach,A. Baucal;T. Zittoun,Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science,"William James proposed a psychological study of religion examining people’s religious experiences, and to see in what sense these were good for them. The recent developments of psychology of religion moved far from that initial proposition. In this paper, we propose a sociocultural perspective to religion that renews with that initial stance. After recalling Vygtotsky’s core ideas, we suggest that religion, as cultural and symbolic system, participates to the orchestration of human activities and sense-making. Such orchestration works both from within the person, through internalized values and ideas, and from without, through the person’s interactions with others, discourses, cultural objects etc. This leads us to consider religions as supporting various forms of dialogical dynamics—intra-psychological dialogues, interpersonal with present, absent or imaginary others, as well as inter-group dialogues—which we illustrate with empirical vignettes. The example of religious tensions in the Balkans in the 90’s highlights how much the historical-cultural embeddedness of these dynamics can also lead to the end of dialogicality, and therefore, sense-making"
516,"Renal angioplasty causes a rapid transient increase in inflammatory biomarkers, but reduced levels of interleukin-6 and endothelin-1 1 month after intervention",A. Alhadad;G. Guron;E. Fortuna-Nowakowska;A. Saeed;I. Mattiasson;G. Jensen;B. Lindblad;A. Gottsäter;H. Herlitz,Journal of Hypertension,"Objective: To examine prospectively whether inflammatory biomarkers and endothelin (ET)-1 are increased in patients with renal artery stenosis (RAS), and to investigate how treatment with percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) affects these variables during the first month after intervention. Methods: One hundred patients with suspected RAS undergoing renal angiography were included. PTRA was performed if the trans-stenotic mean arterial pressure gradient was ≥10 mmHg. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), neopterin , CD40 ligand (CD40L) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were measured before, and 1 day and 1 month after PTRA ( n = 61) or diagnostic angiography only ( n = 39). Results: At baseline there were no significant differences in inflammatory biomarkers or ET-1 levels between patients subsequently undergoing PTRA or angiography only. After angiography, IL-6 and hs-CRP had increased in both groups compared to baseline ( P < 0.001). At this time point hs-CRP (10.90 ± 1.48 versus 6.37 ± 1.61 mg/l; P < 0.05) and IL-6 (13.70 ± 0.94 versus 13.00 ± 0.17 pg/ml; P < 0.01) were higher in the PTRA group than in patients subjected to angiography only. One month after PTRA, systolic blood pressure and levels of IL-6 and ET-1 were lower than before intervention ( P < 0.05), whereas CD40L had increased compared to baseline ( P < 0.01). Conclusion: In patients with RAS, PTRA triggers rapid transient increases in hs-CRP and IL-6; however, 1 month after PTRA, both IL-6 and ET-1 had decreased compared to before intervention, indicating beneficial effects of PTRA on inflammation and the endothelin system."
517,"Renegotiating the Empire, Forging the Nation-State: The Albanian Case through the Political Economic Thought of Ismail Qemali, Fan Noli, and Luigj Gurakuqi, c. 1890–1920s",A. Brisku,Nationalities Papers,"This article examines historical positions regarding the question of the small nation-(state) of Albania remaining “in” the larger Ottoman supranational entity and “out” as independent nation-state during the late 19th and early 20th century. It does so mainly, but not only, through the language of political economy (wealth creation and redistribution) as articulated in the thoughts and deeds of three founding intellectual and political figures of the Albanian nation-(state): Ismail Qemali, Fan Noli, and Luigj Gurakuqi. While lacking a clear political-economic perspective for this emerging nation in the late Ottoman period, all the three figures maintained that as an independent, small nation-state, Albania could survive and perhaps thrive if its wealth and national economic development remained anchored within a larger political and economic space. More than Qemali, Gurakuqi, and Noli envisaged a greater state role in the country’s “national economy-building” process. But while Gurakuqi was more of a “nationalist” on wealth creation, Noli sought to pursue a more “radical,” redistributive path to national development."
518,"Renegotiating the empire, forging the nation(-state): the Bohemian/Czechoslovakian case through the political–economic thought of Thomas G. Masaryk and Karel Kramář, c. 1890–1920s",A. Brisku,Nationalities Papers,"This article explores the dilemma of the small Bohemian Lands/Czechoslovak nation(-state) in staying “in” or “out” of the larger Habsburg supranational entity in the late nineteenth and the early twentieth century. It does so mainly through the language of political economy (on national wealth creation and redistribution) articulated in the opinions and political actions of Czechoslovakia’s two founding statesmen, the first president, Thomas G. Masaryk, and the first prime minister, Karel Kramař. The article argues that their choice of staying “in” the large imperial space was premised upon renegotiating a better political and political–economic deal for the Bohemian Lands, whereas the option of abandoning it and of forging the Czechoslovak nation-state was essentially based on political reasons. And while both advocated an interventionist role for the state in the economy during the imperial period, they considered such a prerogative even more essential for their new nation-state."
519,"Renegotiating the empire, forging the nation-state: the Georgian case through the political economic thought of Niko Nikoladze and Noe Zhordania, c. 1870–1920",A. Brisku,Nationalities Papers,"This article begins with an observation of a contemporary and yet reoccurring political dilemma that small nation-states face with respect to larger states in being either inside or outside of supranational political entities regarding political and economic asymmetries. Employing an intellectual history approach, the article explores this dilemma with reference to the Georgian nation in late-nineteenth century Tsarist Russia and the early twentieth century, when that territory briefly became a nation-state: It explores this through the language of political economy articulated in the thoughts and actions of two founding Georgian national intellectual and political figures, the statesman Niko Nikoladze and Noe Zhordania, who was one of the first prime ministers. It argues that conceiving of the nation(state) primarily in economic terms, as opposed to exclusively nationalist ones, was more conducive to the option of remaining inside a supranational space."
520,Renormalized stress tensor for massive fields in Kerr-Newman spacetime,A. Belokogne;A. Folacci,Physical Review D,"In a four-dimensional spacetime, the DeWitt-Schwinger expansion of the effective action associated with a massive quantum field reduces, after renormalization and in the large mass limit, to a single term constructed from the purely geometrical Gilkey-DeWitt coefficient a3 and its metric variation provides a good analytical approximation for the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the quantum field. Here, from the general expression of this tensor, we obtain analytically the renormalized stress-energy tensors of the massive scalar field, the massive Dirac field and the Proca field in Kerr-Newman spacetime. It should be noted that, even if, at first sight, the expressions obtained are complicated, their structure is in fact rather simple, involving naturally spacetime coordinates as well as the mass M, the charge Q and the rotation parameter a of the Kerr-Newman black hole and permitting us to recover rapidly the results already existing in the literature for the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström and Kerr black holes (and to correct them in the latter case). In the absence of exact results in Kerr-Newman spacetime, our approximate renormalized stress-energy tensors could be very helpful, in particular to study the backreaction of massive quantum fields on this spacetime or on its quasinormal modes."
521,Reorienting a paediatric oral health service towards prevention: lessons from a qualitative study of dental professionals,A. Cashmore;J. Noller;J. Ritchie;B. Johnson;A. Blinkhorn,Health Promotion Journal of Australia,"Issue addressed Reorienting primary care dental services towards prevention is a priority for improving the oral health of Australian children with extensive dental caries. We explored the attitudes and beliefs of dental staff about the factors that helped or hindered the establishment and implementation of a hospital‐based parent counselling program to manage existing, and prevent new, carious lesions in children. A further aim was to explore the influence of the program on the hospital's reorientation to prevention. Methods Eight of nine program staff participated in two focus group interviews, and two co‐ordinating staff participated in semi‐structured interviews. Interviews were audio‐recorded and transcribed. Interview recordings and transcripts were analysed by qualitative thematic analysis. Results The participants identified a number of factors that they felt influenced the establishment and implementation of the program, including the dental team's support of the initiative, the advantages of building on existing clinic infrastructure and procedures, the utility of harnessing dental assistants as a resource for oral health promotion, and the confidence of dental professionals to provide parent counselling. Conclusion Efforts to establish a preventive program in a public paediatric dental service should ensure that all members of the dental team are engaged during all phases of the program, that dental assistants are trained and supported to deliver parent counselling, and that interprofessional partnerships with services such as dietetics are fostered. So what? The establishment of the program catalysed a broader focus on, and a stronger commitment to, oral health promotion. This study has highlighted the potential for reorientation of dental services towards oral health promotion and the steps that will enable this to be embedded within practice."
522,Repositioning Students in Initial Teacher Preparation: A Comparative Descriptive Analysis of Learning to Teach for Social Justice in the United States and in England,A. Cook-Sather;B. Youens,Journal of Teacher Education,"Discussions of learning to teach for social justice generally focus on the social commitments, institutional structures, course content, and pedagogical processes that support prospective teachers. Missing from this array of foci is a consideration of how school students are positioned within teacher preparation and how their positioning and participation can inform prospective teachers’ preparation to teach for social justice. In this article, the authors present a comparative descriptive analysis of two projects, one based in the United States and one based in England, that provide opportunities through which prospective secondary teachers are prepared to teach for social justice through direct dialogue with secondary students focused on issues of teaching and learning."
523,"Reprint of ""Vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women impairs regulatory T cell function""",A. Chary;R. Hemalatha;M. Seshacharyulu;M. Murali;B. Kumar,Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,"Regulatory T cells and IgE receptors (CD23 and CD21) on B cells were assessed in vitamin D deficient pregnant women. For this, 153 pregnant women were recruited from a government hospital and were categorized into three groups based on 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) status. Regulatory T cell population (Treg cells) and CD23/CD21 expression on B cells were quantified by FACS ARIA II in maternal blood at third trimester; and the same parameters were evaluated in cord blood soon after delivery. In addition, TGF β and IL-10 were quantified in maternal and cord blood by using Milliplex kits. In a representative sample of eight women from each group (vitamin D sufficient, insufficient and deficient), placental tissues were processed for mRNA expressions of vitamin D receptor (VDR), retinoic acid receptor (RXR), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and vitamin D regulating enzymes. Of the 153 pregnant women, 18 were sufficient (≥30 ng/mL), 55 were insufficient (20–29 ng/mL) and 80 were deficient (≤19 ng/mL) for 25(OH)D3 status. The maternal blood Treg cell population (mean (%) ± SE) was lower (p &lt; 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 deficient (0.2 ± 0.01) pregnant women compared to insufficient (0.34 ± 0.01) and sufficient (0.45 ± 0.02) pregnant women. Similarly, cord blood Treg cell population (mean (%) ± SE) was also lower (p &lt; 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 deficient (0.63 ± 0.03) pregnant women when compared to insufficient (1.05 ± 0.04) and sufficient (1.75 ± 0.02) pregnant women. Mean (%) ± SE of B cells with CD23 and CD21 in maternal blood was higher (p &lt; 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 deficient pregnant women (0.35 ± 0.02; 1.65 ± 0.04) when compared to insufficient (0.22 ± 0.02; 0.55 ± 0.05) and sufficient (0.15 ± 0.02; 0.21 ± 0.01) pregnant women. Similarly, mean (%) ± SE of B cell population with CD23 and CD21 in cord blood was also higher (p &lt; 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 deficient (0.41 ± 0.02; 1.2 ± 0.03) when compared to insufficient (0.32 ± 0.01; 0.6 ± 0.05) and sufficient (0.2 ± 0.01; 0.4 ± 0.02) pregnant women.Regulatory cytokines, TGF β and IL-10 were lower (p &lt; 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 insufficient and deficient subjects. In the placenta tissue of women with 25(OH)D3 deficiency, the regulatory T cell transcription factor FOXP3, vitamin D receptor (VDR) and retinoic acid receptor (RXR) expressions were downregulated. In contrast, CD23, CD21 and VDBP expressions were upregulated in 25(OH)D3 deficient and insufficient women. Vitamin D regulating enzymes (CYP24A1, CYP2R1 and CYP27B1) expression were also altered in women with 25(OH)D3 deficiency. The current study shows that impaired maternal 25(OH)D3 during pregnancy influences the spectrum of immune cells such as regulatory T cells and B cells with IgE receptors and this in turn may be linked to allergy and asthma in neonates."
524,Reproducibility in Psychology: Theoretical Distinction of Different Types of Replications,A. Baucal;A. Gillespie;K. Krstić;T. Zittoun,Integrative Psychological and Behavioral Science,"Debates about replication in psychology have focused on methodological issues and how to strengthen the replication culture. In most cases, these discussions have tended to assume that the phenomena being investigated are universal. In this paper, we are going to propose a theoretical distinction of different types of replication. The distinction is based on the assumption that besides of universal psychological phenomena there are also phenomena, especially in social and cultural psychology, that are expected to vary between socio-cultural contexts and across history. Taking this insight to its logical conclusion it implies that the main purpose of a replication and interpretation of its results depends on the phenomenon being studied. In the case of the universal phenomena, the replication serves to validation purpose, while in the case of the socio-cultural phenomenon it serves to advance our theoretical understanding of how the given phenomenon is formatted by the socio-cultural-historical context."
525,Repurposing FDA-approved drugs as therapeutics to treat Rift Valley fever virus infection,A. Benedict;N. Bansal;S. Senina;I. Hooper;L. Lundberg;C. Fuente;A. Narayanan;B. Gutting;K. Kehn-Hall,Frontiers in Microbiology,"There are currently no FDA-approved therapeutics available to treat Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection. In an effort to repurpose drugs for RVFV treatment, a library of FDA-approved drugs was screened to determine their ability to inhibit RVFV. Several drugs from varying compound classes, including inhibitors of growth factor receptors, microtubule assembly/disassembly, and DNA synthesis, were found to reduce RVFV replication. The hepatocellular and renal cell carcinoma drug, sorafenib, was the most effective inhibitor, being non-toxic and demonstrating inhibition of RVFV in a cell-type and virus strain independent manner. Mechanism of action studies indicated that sorafenib targets at least two stages in the virus infectious cycle, RNA synthesis and viral egress. Computational modeling studies also support this conclusion. siRNA knockdown of Raf proteins indicated that non-classical targets of sorafenib are likely important for the replication of RVFV."
526,Research as Artisanship versus Research as Generation of Novelty: The March to Nowhere,A. Cropley,Creativity Research Journal,"The desire to ensure that its findings stand up to scrutiny is leading to a redefinition of research as skilled application of special techniques rather than a search for fresh insights. Generating novelty is now being seen as dangerous, because it could lead to false conclusions and loss of public confidence. The remedy is said to be replicability. However, replicability is not the goal of research, but a criterion for testing the robustness of novel ideas. The real problem is not excessive focus on novelty, but the poor quality of public dissemination of research findings. Thus, what is needed are public education and a responsible role for the media in informing the public, not the self-imposition of stifling orthodoxy on research."
527,Research of beef-meaty aroma compounds from yeast extract using carbon module labeling (CAMOLA) technique,A. Alim;H. Song;Y. Liu;T. Zou;A. Raza,LWT - Food Science and Technology,"Meat flavors produced from non-animal source is a promising topic targeting the market demand in special context to vegetarian community. In this research work, key volatiles related to beef like odors were identified from a meat-like flavor system (YE-xylose- cysteine-thiamine). The aroma-active compounds were detected through GC-O-MS. To deduce the formation pathways of key beef-meaty aroma compounds, the carbohydrate module labeling (CAMOLA) experiment was adopted for Maillard reaction. A model study was conducted using the identified peptides, [13C5] xylose/xylose (1:1), cysteine and thiamine. Finally, key beef like aroma compounds were selected through comparing the results of meat-like flavor systems with the model experiment. The detected odorants were mainly divided into pyrazines (6 types), furans (7 types), 2-methylthiophene and 4-methyl-5-hydroxyethylthiazole. The carbon skeleton sources of the compounds were inferred based on GC-MS data from model systems."
528,Resisting the Impositional Potential of Student Voice Work: Lessons for liberatory educational research from poststructuralist feminist critiques of critical pedagogy,A. Cook-Sather,Discourse,"Early 21st-century cautions regarding student voice work in educational research echo in striking ways some poststructuralist feminist critiques of critical pedagogies that proliferated in the early 1990s. Both warn against totalizing, undifferentiated notions of and responses to oppressed, marginalized, and/or disempowered individuals or groups while sharing a commitment to the encouragement of critical analyses of existing social conditions (within and beyond classrooms) and the advocacy of changing dominant arrangements of power and participation. In this article, I explore how conceptions of and cautions regarding two key foci of liberatory efforts—identity and voice—throw into relief the impositional potential of those efforts. I offer the conceptual framework provided by “translation” to support a rethinking of students’ and researchers’ identities, roles, and participation in educational research as one of many necessarily ongoing efforts to resist the impositional potential of student voice work."
529,Resistivity surveys near a waste-disposal site in the Qasr Tuba area of central Jordan,A. Batayneh;M. Barjous,Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment,"Direct current (DC) Schlumberger resistivity sounding and dipole-dipole resistivity profiling experiments were conducted at the border of an 2.2 long×1 km wide open waste disposal site in central Jordan. The site is on an approximately 20 m thick limestone, chert and chalk rock sequence and is surrounded by a series of hills. Lying upstream of an urban area, agricultural land and numerous groundwater wells, any contamination spreading from the waste disposal site could have a serious effect on the people and the environment. In this study, the subsurface resistivity distribution was mapped and compared with the data obtained from boreholes and aerial photographs. DC resistivity methods were found to be a fast and inexpensive data collection tool. The results obtained will be of use for engineering preparations and the operation of the site, as well as for monitoring any future pollution. Des sondages électriques verticaux par la méthode Schlumberger et des traînés de résistivité par la méthode dipole-dipole ont été réalisés aux limites d’un site de stockage de déchets de 2,2 km de long et de 1 km de large en Jordanie centrale. Le stockage repose sur une série d’environ 20 m d’épaisseur de calcaires, concrétions siliceuses et craie, et le site est entouré de collines. Le site étant situé en amont d’une zone urbaine, d’une zone agricole et de nombreux puits d’alimentation en eau, toute contamination issue du stockage de déchets pourrait avoir de sérieux effets sur la population et sur l’environnement. Dans cette étude, la carte de répartition des résistivités dans le sous-sol a été confrontée aux données fournies par les sondages mécaniques et les photographiques aériennes. Les méthodes de prospection électrique constituent un outil pour obtenir rapidement et à moindre coût un ensemble de données. Les résultats obtenus seront utiles dans les études de conception et de réalisation du stockage ainsi que pour le contrôle futur d’éventuelles pollutions."
530,Resolving conflicting objectives in the management of the Plastiras Lake: can we quantify beauty?,A. Christofides;A. Efstratiadis;D. Koutsoyiannis;G. Sargentis;K. Hadjibiros,Hydrology and Earth System Sciences,"The possible water management of the Plastiras Lake, an artificial reservoir in central Greece, is examined. The lake and surrounding landscape are aesthetically degraded when the water level drops, and the requirement of maintaining a high quality of the scenery constitutes one of the several conflicting water uses, the other ones being irrigation, water supply, and power production. This environmental water use, and, to a lesser extent, the requirement for adequate water quality, results in constraining the annual release. Thus, the allowed fluctuation of reservoir stage is not defined by the physical and technical characteristics of the reservoir, but by a multi-criteria decision, the three criteria being maximising water release, ensuring adequate water quality, and maintaining a high quality of the natural landscape. Each of these criteria is analyzed separately. The results are then put together in a multicriterion tableau, which helps understand the implications of the possible alternative decisions. Several conflict resolution methods are overviewed, namely willingness to pay, hedonic prices, and multi-criteria decision analysis. All these methods attempt to quantify non-quantifiable qualities, and it is concluded that they don't necessarily offer any advantage over merely making a choice based on understanding."

Nelson;M. Reinhard;D. Sokaras;R. Alonso-Mori,Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,"Femtosecond-resolved Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) measurements of solvated transition metal complexes are successfully implemented at the X-ray Free Electron Laser LCLS. Benchmark experiments on [Fe(terpy)2]2+ in solution show a signal-to-noise ratio on the order of 500, comparable to typical 100 ps-resolution synchrotron measurements. In the few femtoseconds after photoexcitation, we observe the EXAFS fingerprints of a short-lived (∼100 fs) intermediate as well as those of a vibrationally hot long-lived (∼ns) excited state."
532,"Respecting voices: how the co-creation of teaching and learning can support academic staff, underrepresented students, and equitable practices",A. Cook-Sather,Higher Education,"Analyses of how staff and student voices are, or are not, respected in higher education typically unfold in separate conversations. In this discussion, I use narrative analysis of several sources—primary research data, informal participant feedback, and participants’ published essays—to present a case study of how the co-creation of teaching and learning through one pedagogical partnership program brings the voices of staff and students into dialogue. The case study reveals how participating staff and students can develop voices that both speak respectfully and are self-respecting and that can, in turn, contribute to the development of more equitable classroom practices. I provide context for this case study by bringing together key points from literature on staff voice and on student voice, defining co-creation, describing the partnership program, and explaining my research method. The case study itself is constituted by the voices of staff and students who have participated in the partnership program. Drawing on staff words, I show how co-creation supports those staff members in developing voice through dialogue with a diversity of students voices; generating ways of discussing and addressing inequity; and constructing more equitable classroom approaches. Drawing on students’ words, I show how co-creation supports those students in developing voice by positioning them as pedagogical partners to staff and inviting them into dialogue with their staff partners; affirming that they can carry those voices into courses in which they are enrolled; and emboldening them to participate in ongoing conversations about the experiences of underrepresented and underserved students."
533,Respiratory sensitization: toxicological point of view on the available assays,A. Chary;J. Hennen;S. Klein;T. Serchi;A. Gutleb;B. Blömeke,Archives of Toxicology,"Respiratory sensitization as a consequence of exposure to chemical products has increased over the last decades, leading to an increase of morbidity. The increased use of synthetic compounds resulted in an exponential growth of substances to which we are potentially exposed on a daily basis. Some of them are known to induce respiratory sensitization, meaning that they can trigger the development of allergies. In the past, animal studies provided useful results for the understanding of mechanisms involved in the development of respiratory allergies. However, the mechanistic understanding of the involved cellular effects is still limited. Currently, no in vitro or in vivo models are validated to identify chemical respiratory sensitizers. Nonetheless, chemical respiratory sensitizers elicit a positive response in validated assays for skin sensitization. In this review, we will discuss how these assays could be used for respiratory sensitization and if necessary, what can be learnt from these assays to develop a model to assess the respiratory sensitizing potential of chemicals. In the last decades, much work has been done to study the respiratory toxicity of inhaled compounds especially in developing in vitro assays grown at the air–liquid interface. We will discuss how possibly the tests currently used to investigate general particle toxicity could be transformed to investigate respiratory sensitization. In the present review, we describe the most known mechanism involved in the sensitization process and the experimental in vivo and alternative in vitro models, which are currently available and how to adapt and improve existing models to study respiratory sensitization."
534,Respiratory viruses in young South African children with acute lower respiratory infections and interactions with HIV,A. Annamalay;S. Abbott;C. Sikazwe;S. Khoo;P. Souëf,Journal of Clinical Virology,"Human rhinovirus (RV) is the most common respiratory virus and has been associated with frequent and severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI). The prevalence of RV species among HIV-infected children in South Africa is unknown.To describe the prevalence of respiratory viruses, including RV species, associated with HIV status and other clinical symptoms in children less than two years of age with and without ALRI in Pretoria, South Africa.Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 105 hospitalized ALRI cases and 53 non-ALRI controls less than two years of age. HIV status was determined. Common respiratory viruses were identified by PCR, and RV species and genotypes were identified by semi-nested PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyses.Respiratory viruses were more common among ALRI cases than controls (83.8% vs. 69.2%; p = 0.041). RV was the most commonly identified virus in cases with pneumonia (45.6%) or bronchiolitis (52.1%), regardless of HIV status, as well as in controls (39.6%). RV-A was identified in 26.7% of cases and 15.1% of controls while RV-C was identified in 21.0% of cases and 18.9% of controls. HIV-infected children were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia than bronchiolitis (p &lt; 0.01). RSV was not identified in any HIV-infected cases (n = 15) compared with 30.6% of HIV-uninfected cases (n = 85, p = 0.013), and was identified more frequently in bronchiolitis than in pneumonia cases (43.8% vs. 12.3%; p &lt; 0.01).RV-A and RV-C are endemic in South African children and HIV infection may be protective against RSV and bronchiolitis.Human rhinovirus is the most common virus in cases with pneumonia or bronchiolitis and in controls.HIV-infected children were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia than bronchiolitis.RSV was not identified in any HIV-infected cases compared with one third of HIV-uninfected cases.Human rhinovirus (RV) is the most common respiratory virus and has been associated with frequent and severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI). The prevalence of RV species among HIV-infected children in South Africa is unknown.To describe the prevalence of respiratory viruses, including RV species, associated with HIV status and other clinical symptoms in children less than two years of age with and without ALRI in Pretoria, South Africa.Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 105 hospitalized ALRI cases and 53 non-ALRI controls less than two years of age. HIV status was determined. Common respiratory viruses were identified by PCR, and RV species and genotypes were identified by semi-nested PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyses.Respiratory viruses were more common among ALRI cases than controls (83.8% vs. 69.2%; p = 0.041). RV was the most commonly identified virus in cases with pneumonia (45.6%) or bronchiolitis (52.1%), regardless of HIV status, as well as in controls (39.6%). RV-A was identified in 26.7% of cases and 15.1% of controls while RV-C was identified in 21.0% of cases and 18.9% of controls. HIV-infected children were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia than bronchiolitis (p &lt; 0.01).

535,Responding to sex-based discrimination: Gender differences in perceived discrimination and implications for legal decision making,A. Blodorn;L. O'Brien;J. Kordys,Group Processes and Intergroup Relations,"The present studies examine responses to individual and institutional sex-based discrimination and how these responses vary as a function of the perceiver’s gender. In Study 1A, women perceived more sexism than men and the magnitude of the gender gap was significantly larger for institutional sexism as compared to individual sexism. Study 1B provided validation for the measures of perceptions of individual and institutional sexism. In Study 2, participants reached a verdict and determined remedies in a lawsuit where the plaintiff was a woman claiming to be a victim of individual or institutional sexism. Women were more likely than men to render a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. When the plaintiff was a victim of individual discrimination, men and women awarded comparable remedies but when the plaintiff was a victim of institutional sexism, women awarded significantly more remedies than men. Thus the present research suggests that gender moderates responses to institutional and individual forms of discrimination and these gender differences may have important implications for victims of discrimination."
536,Results from the TARC experiment: spallation neutron phenomenology in lead and neutron-driven nuclear transmutation by adiabatic resonance crossing,A. Abánades;J. Aleixandre;S. Andriamonje;A. Angelopoulos;K. Zioutas,"Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment","We summarize here the results of the TARC experiment whose main purpose is to demonstrate the possibility of using Adiabatic Resonance Crossing (ARC) to destroy efficiently Long-Lived Fission Fragments (LLFFs) in accelerator-driven systems and to validate a new simulation developed in the framework of the Energy Amplifier programme. An experimental set-up was installed in a CERN PS proton beam line to study how neutrons produced by spallation at relatively high energy (En⩾1MeV) slow down quasi-adiabatically with almost flat isolethargic energy distribution and reach the capture resonance energy of an element to be transmuted where they will have a high probability of being captured. Precision measurements of energy and space distributions of spallation neutrons (using 2.5 and 3.5 GeV/c protons) slowing down in a 3.3 m×3.3 m×3 m lead volume and of neutron capture rates on LLFFs 99Tc, 129I, and several other elements were performed. An appropriate formalism and appropriate computational tools necessary for the analysis and understanding of the data were developed and validated in detail. Our direct experimental observation of ARC demonstrates the possibility to destroy, in a parasitic mode, outside the Energy Amplifier core, large amounts of 99Tc or 129I at a rate exceeding the production rate, thereby making it practical to reduce correspondingly the existing stockpile of LLFFs. In addition, TARC opens up new possibilities for radioactive isotope production as an alternative to nuclear reactors, in particular for medical applications, as well as new possibilities for neutron research and industrial applications.We summarize here the results of the TARC experiment whose main purpose is to demonstrate the possibility of using Adiabatic Resonance Crossing (ARC) to destroy efficiently Long-Lived Fission Fragments (LLFFs) in accelerator-driven systems and to validate a new simulation developed in the framework of the Energy Amplifier programme.

Venkatasubramanian;S. Rao;C. Webers;T. Berendschot;N. Rao,Bipolar Disorders,"The examination of retinal microvascular abnormalities through fundus photography is currently the best available non‐invasive technique for assessment of cerebral vascular status. Several studies in the last decade have reported higher incidences of adverse cerebrovascular events in Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD). However, retinal microvasculature abnormalities in SCZ and BD have remained under‐explored, and no study has compared this aspect of SCZ and BD till date."
539,Retinal vascular fractal dimension in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia,A. Appaji;B. Nagendra;D. Chako;A. Padmanabha;N. Rao,Journal of Affective Disorders,"Bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ), are associated with greater vascular co-morbidities and adverse vascular events. Owing to shared developmental origins and morphology, retinal vasculature is a proxy assessment measure of the cerebral vasculature. Although retinal vascular fractal dimension (Df), a measure of vascular geometry and complexity of branching, has been shown to be directly associated with cerebrovascular pathology, it has not been examined in SCZ and BD.We studied 277 participants (92 healthy volunteers, 98 SCZ, and 87 BD) from 18 to 50 years of age. Images were acquired by trained personnel using a non-mydriatic fundus camera and the retinal vascular Df was calculated by the box-counting method using an automated algorithm. The average Df across the left and right eyes were calculated.Both SCZ and BD had significantly increased Df compared to HV despite controlling for possible confounding factors. However, there was no significant difference between SCZ and BD. These findings suggest abnormal retinal vascular Df in psychoses.The study design was cross-sectional, and patients were on medications. Confound of lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise, if any, was not controlled. Sub-group analysis between BD-I and BD-II was not performed in view of the small sample.Considering the easy accessibility, affordability, and non-invasive nature of the examination, retinal vascular Df could serve as a surrogate marker for cerebral vascular abnormality and could potentially identify BD and SCZ patients at risk of developing adverse vascular events."
540,Retinal vascular tortuosity in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,A. Appaji;B. Nagendra;D. Chako;A. Padmanabha;N. Rao,Schizophrenia Research,"The micro-vasculature of retina and brain share common morphological, physiological, and pathological properties. Retina being easily accessible, retinal vascular examination provides an indirect assessment of cerebral vasculature. Considering the high prevalence of vascular morbidity in SCZ and BD a few studies have examined retinal vascular caliber and have reported increased retinal venular caliber in schizophrenia (SCZ). Retinal vascular tortuosity could serve as a better structural measure than caliber as it is static and less susceptible to pulse period variations. However, to date, no study has examined retinal vascular tortuosity in SCZ and bipolar disorder (BD). Hence, we examined retinal vascular tortuosity in comparison with healthy volunteers (HV). We included 255 subjects (78 HV, 79 SCZ, and 86 BD) in the age range of 18 to 50 years. Trained personnel acquired images using a non-mydriatic fundus camera. To measure the average retinal arteriolar tortuosity index (RATI) and retinal venular tortuosity index (RVTI), we used a previously validated, semi-automatic algorithm. The results showed significant differences across the three groups in RATI but not in RVTI; both BD and SCZ had significantly increased RATI compared to HV. There was also a significant difference between SCZ and BD, with BD having higher RATI. If shown to be of predictive utility in future longitudinal studies, it has the potential to identify patients at risk of development of adverse vascular events. As retinal vascular imaging is non-invasive and inexpensive, it could serve as a proxy marker and window to cerebral vasculature."
541,Retroauricular Transmeatal Approach to Manage Mandibular Condylar Head Fractures,A. Benech;F. Arcuri;N. Baragiotta;M. Nicolotti;M. Brucoli,Journal of Craniofacial Surgery,"Background: There is a multitude of reported surgical approaches and technical variants with some unresolved technical problems to gain direct access to mandibular condylar head fractures ; they can be divided into 2 groups: intraoral and extraoral. In 2005, Neff et al ( Mund Kiefer Gesichtschir 2005;9:80), supported by a previous experimental work, reported a successful clinical study of condylar head fractures treated by a retroauricular approach ; this article is in German, and the later English-language literature does not mention about this approach to open reduction and internal fixation of mandibular condylar fractures. The retroauricular transmeatal access , selected and performed by the senior author to treat 14 patients affected by highly located condylar head fracture, is illustrated in details. Methods: We collected data of 14 consecutive adult patients who, after the discussion about all options, had consented to have 16 mandibular condylar head fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation by miniplates and screws via a retroauricular transmeatal approach. We exposed the temporomandibular joint area easily and better by dissecting via a retroauricular route with identification, ligation, and transection of the retromandibular vein; because of the posterior access, the frontal branch of the facial nerve and the auriculotemporal nerve are located and protected within the substance of the anteriorly retracted flap, superficial to the retromandibular vein. The follow-up clinical examination showed temporary weakness of the frontal branch of the facial nerve in 1 case with a recovery to normal function of 1.6 months; no patients had permanent weakness of the facial nerve or injury of the auriculotemporal nerve. There was absence of any salivary fistula, sialocele, and Frey syndrome; hearing was preserved in all cases, without any auditory stenosis or aesthetic deformity, and there was absence of any infections, hematoma, or scarring. Conclusions: Retroauricular approach provides good exposure of the temporomandibular joint and satisfactory protection from nerve injuries and vascular lesions, allowing an adequate osteosynthesis. The scar is hidden behind the ear, and the morbidity is low in terms of auditory stenosis, aesthetic deformity, and salivary fistulas."
542,Revascularisation of renal artery stenosis caused by fibromuscular dysplasia: effects on blood pressure during 7-year follow-up are influenced by duration of hypertension and branch artery stenosis,A. Alhadad;I. Mattiasson;K. Ivancev;A. Gottsäter;B. Lindblad,Journal of Human Hypertension,"Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) mainly affects renal arteries. Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) and surgery are effective treatments, but long-time follow-up is lacking. Retrospective follow-up for 7.0±4.7 years of 69 consecutive patients (age 44±13 years) treated for hypertension due to FMD, 59 patients underwent PTRA and eight patients surgery. In two patients no PTRA was performed. Technical success was achieved in 56 (95%) patients undergoing PTRA and all eight undergoing surgery. After successful PTRA, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP) had decreased at discharge (from 174±33/100±13 to 138±19/80±15 mmHg; P<0.0001), and remained lower at 1 month, 1 year, and last follow-up after 7.0±4.7 years (140±25/83±12 mmHg; P<0.0001). Serum-creatinine had decreased both at 1 year (from 84±28 to 75±13 μmol/l; P=0.0030) and last follow-up (75±16 μmol/l; P=0.0017). The number of antihypertensive drugs decreased (from 2.3±1.2 before PTRA to 1.4±1.3 at discharge and at 1 month; P<0.0001, and 1.6±1.5 at last follow-up; P=0.0011). SBP decreased more after PTRA among patients with FMD only in the main renal artery than in those with branch artery involvement (43±29 vs 20±41 mmHg; P=0.0198). Beneficial effects on BP, creatinine and antihypertensive drugs also occurred after surgery. Patients on antihypertensive drugs at last follow-up had longer hypertension duration before PTRA than those without (5.9±7.7 vs 1.8±4.1 years; P=0.0349). Cure was achieved in 16 (24%), improvement in another 26(39%), and benefit in 42(63%).

543,Reverse translated and gold standard continuous performance tests predict global cognitive performance in schizophrenia,A. Bismark;M. Thomas;M. Tarasenko;A. Shiluk;S. Rackelmann;J. Young;G. Light,Translational Psychiatry,"Attentional dysfunction contributes to functional impairments in schizophrenia (SZ). Sustained attention is typically assessed via continuous performance tasks (CPTs), though many CPTs have limited cross-species translational validity and place demands on additional cognitive domains. A reverse-translated 5-Choice Continuous Performance Task (5C-CPT) for human testing—originally developed for use in rodents—was designed to minimize demands on perceptual, visual learning, processing speed, or working memory functions. To-date, no studies have validated the 5C-CPT against gold standard attentional measures nor evaluated how 5C-CPT scores relate to cognition in SZ. Here we examined the relationship between the 5C-CPT and the CPT-Identical Pairs (CPT-IP), an established and psychometrically robust measure of vigilance from the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) in a sample of SZ patients (n = 35). Relationships to global and individual subdomains of cognition were also assessed. 5C-CPT and CPT-IP measures of performance (d-prime) were strongly correlated (r = 0.60). In a regression model, the 5C-CPT and CPT-IP collectively accounted for 54% of the total variance in MCCB total scores, and 27.6% of overall cognitive variance was shared between the 5C-CPT and CPT-IP. These results indicate that the reverse translated 5C-CPT and the gold standard CPT-IP index a common attentional construct that also significantly overlaps with variance in general cognitive performance. The use of simple, cross-species validated behavioral indices of attentional/cognitive functioning such as the 5C-CPT could accelerate the development of novel generalized pro-cognitive therapeutics for SZ and related neuropsychiatric disorders."
544,Reversed Brayton cycle for food freezing at very low temperatures: Energy performance and optimisation,A. Biglia;L. Comba;E. Fabrizio;P. Gay;D. Aimonino,International Journal of Refrigeration,"Freezing is a valuable method to increase food shelf life and to ensure high quality standards during long-term storage. Additional benefits to frozen food quality can be achieved by freezing at very low temperatures (&lt; −50 °C): small ice crystal formation during fast freezing reduces food cell wall rupture, preventing water and texture loss during thawing. This paper presents the design of an innovative food freezing system operating at very low temperatures, based on a modified reversed Brayton cycle (rB cycle). The plant is composed of two interconnected sub-systems: a primary thermodynamic closed loop, operated by an rB cycle, and a secondary airflow loop which is devoted to food freezing by batch process. Relevant features of the designed rB cycle rely on the adopted environmentally safe working fluid, the optimised thermodynamics working conditions and the innovative cycle layout. A modelling framework for the system was developed to identify and design efficient operative settings for the plant components (turbo-machineries, heat exchangers, etc.) and to assess, via sensitivity analysis, the influence of the main design parameters on the global energy performance. The proposed system configuration, designed to maximise the coefficient of performance (CoP) value of the plant, was determined by means of nonlinear multivariable optimisation. In addition, the energy performance of the system can be increased by recovering waste heat available from the rB cycle.An innovative system for food freezing at very low temperature has been designed.The system is based on a modified reversed Brayton cycle.Performance analysis results show the pressure level as a relevant parameter.The proposed system has lower running cost than liquid nitrogen plants.Freezing is a valuable method to increase food shelf life and to ensure high quality standards during long-term storage.

In first book the members of the correlation are on the one hand such factors as sympathy with the doctrines of the church, belief in the infallibility of the Bible, belief that Jesus was born of a virgin and that Lazarus was raised from the dead, enjoyment of sermons, belief that preachers are sincere, etc. In the second a largely identical set of characteristics constitutes the second member of the correlation study where the first member is the sense of the Divine Presence. A consideration overlooked, however, is that any question regarding the experience of a Divine Presence is likely to be not one question but a covert presentation of two questions. In the third book, study on the relation of Biblical information to character and conduct, one of the correlates comprises propensities for cheating and for lying as well as for loyalty and altruism was conducted. In the final book, study presents the appraisals rendered by seven experts who read 63 Old Testament stories taken from a collection of 76 found in various Sunday School curricula. These experts read and judged in addition 74 books of Bible stories adapted for children. The stories and the books were graded with regard to literary quality, grade placement and ethical situations."
546,"Review of Creativity, mental illness and crime.",A. Cropley,"Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts","Reviews the book, Creativity, mental illness and crime by R. Eisenman (see record 2007-11163-000). By combining published research findings, data from official sources such as the United States Department of Justice National Crime Victimization Study, a certain amount of data from his own research, and the knowledge of many years experience, the author reflects upon issues such as drug and sex education in schools, school-sanctioned violence against children, the desirability of the death penalty, and mistreatment of the mentally ill in a prison treatment program, to give a few examples. Unfortunately, however, such topics are not linked by a genuine unified theme or a systematic attack on the issues mentioned in the title, and the book is really a set of loosely linked statements on issues broadly connected with socially disapproved behavior, and treatment of criminals and those who, more generally, do not ""fit in"". The secret to profiting from reading it is not to treat it as another standard academic book. The author draws attention to often neglected issues in a very direct way, getting straight to the heart of the matter, and adopting a clear position. In doing so, he risks censure for adopting politically incorrect positions such as emphasizing the viciousness and lack of remorse of many young offenders, pointing out that those students who report greatest availability of drugs in their school receive the least drug education, or even concluding that the death penalty is something that society needs. What the author has to say is short and to the point, unequivocal, clearly stated in highly readable English, and often thought provoking."
547,"Review of plant-vanadium physiological interactions, bioaccumulation, and bioremediation of vanadium-contaminated sites",A. Aihemaiti;Y. Gao;Y. Meng;X. Chen;J. Jiang,Science of the Total Environment,"Vanadium is a multivalent redox-sensitive metal that is widely distributed in the environment. Low levels of vanadium elevate plant height, root length, and biomass production due to enhanced chlorophyll biosynthesis, seed germination, essential element uptake, and nitrogen assimilation and utilization. However, high vanadium concentrations disrupt energy metabolism and matter cycling; inhibit key enzymes mediating energy production, protein synthesis, ion transportation, and other important physiological processes; and lead to growth retardation, root and shoot abnormalities, and even death of plants. The threshold level of toxicity is highly plant species-specific, and in most cases, the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of vanadium for plants grown under hydroponic conditions and in soil varies from 1 to 50 mg/L, and from 18 to 510 mg/kg, respectively. Plants such as Chinese green mustard, chickpea, and bunny cactus could accumulate high concentrations of vanadium in their tissues, and thus are suitable for decontaminating and reclaiming of vanadium-polluted soils on a large scale. Soil pH, organic matter, and the contents of iron and aluminum (hydr)oxides, phosphorus, calcium, and other coexisting elements affect the bioavailability, toxicity, and plant uptake of vanadium. Mediation of these conditions or properties in vanadium-contaminated soils could improve plant tolerance, accumulation, or exclusion, thereby enhancing phytoremediation efficiency. Phytoremediation with the assistance of soil amendments and microorganisms is a promising method for decontamination of vanadium polluted soils."

Bassat,Tropical Medicine & International Health,"en Objectives To describe the prevalence of human rhinovirus (RV) species in children hospitalised with pneumonia in Manhiça, Mozambique, and the associations between RV species and demographic, clinical and laboratory features. Methods Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from children 0 to 10 years of age (n = 277) presenting to Manhiça District Hospital with clinical pneumonia. Blood samples were collected for HIV and malaria testing, blood culture and full blood counts, and a chest X‐ray was performed. A panel of common respiratory viruses was investigated using two independent multiplex RT‐PCR assays with primers specific for each virus and viral type. RV species and genotypes were identified by seminested PCR assays, sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyses. Results At least one respiratory virus was identified in 206 (74.4%) children hospitalised with clinical pneumonia. RV was the most common virus identified in both HIV‐infected (17 of 38, 44.7%) and HIV‐uninfected (74 of 237, 31.2%; P = 0.100) children. RV‐A was the most common RV species identified (47 of 275, 17.0%), followed by RV‐C (35/275, 12.6%) and RV‐B (8/275, 2.9%).

549,Ribosomal Protein L19 Is a Prognostic Marker for Human Prostate Cancer,A. Bee;Y. Ke;S. Forootan;K. Lin;C. Beesley;S. Forrest;C. Foster,Clinical Cancer Research,"Microquantity differential display analysis of gene expression profiles between benign (PNT2) and malignant (PC3M) human prostate cell lines identified the gene encoding ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19) to be overexpressed in the malignant cells. Northern blot hybridization analysis done on a wide range of human cell lines and tissues confirmed the level of RPL19 mRNA to be 5-fold higher in malignant cell lines and 8-fold higher in malignant tissues, when compared with their benign counterparts. Analysis of RPL19 mRNA expression by in situ hybridization revealed a significant increase of RPL19 expression in a substantial number of prostate cancers. All of the eight normal prostatic tissues were unstained (100%). Of 32 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues, 15 (46.9%) were unstained, 9 (28.1%) stained weakly, and 8 (25%) stained moderately. Among 87 carcinomas, only 7 (8.1%) were unstained, whereas 22 (25.2%) stained weakly, 21 (24.1%) stained moderately, and 37 (42.61%) stained strongly. The intensity of staining of the malignant specimens was significantly higher than that of normal and BPH specimens (χ2: n = 127, P < 0.001). Gleason scores of the carcinomas correlated with RPL19 expression (χ2: n = 87, P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed increased RPL19 expression to be highly predictive of shorter patient survival (P < 0.05), revealing RPL19 to be a sensitive predictor of prostate cancer progression. Expression of this protein could be a valuable marker in prostate cancer diagnosis and patient management."
550,Rift-margin extensional forced folds and salt tectonics in the eastern Basque-Cantabrian rift basin (western Pyrenees),A. Bodego;E. Iriarte;M. López-Horgue;I. Álvarez,Marine and Petroleum Geology,"In this paper we present and discuss Cretaceous extensional folds of the eastern Basque-Cantabrian Basin (Northern Spain). Geometry and kinematics of folds is constrained by means of structural and sedimentological fieldwork integrated with geological mapping, revealing an intimate link between coeval folding, extensional faulting, and salt mobilization. In detail, the Mesozoic succession of the northwestern and southern borders of the Palaeozoic Bortziriak-Cinco Villas massif (eastern margin of the BCB) host late Albian–early Cenomanian syn-rift forced folds. The studied forced fold axes trend parallel and are located above main and inferred Cretaceous syn-sedimentary basement faults. Structural data indicate that these folds formed during the late Albian − early Cenomanian interval. The presence of Upper Triassic clay and evaporite outcrops along and/or close to the axes of folds and their stratigraphic relationship with Upper Cretaceous strata indicate their halokinetic origin and extrusion during folding.

551,Rise of the Machines: Algorithmic Trading in the Foreign Exchange Market,A. Chaboud;B. Chiquoine;E. Hjalmarsson;C. Vega,Journal of Finance,"We study the impact of algorithmic trading (AT) in the foreign exchange market using a long time series of high‐frequency data that identify computer‐generated trading activity. We find that AT causes an improvement in two measures of price efficiency: the frequency of triangular arbitrage opportunities and the autocorrelation of high‐frequency returns. We show that the reduction in arbitrage opportunities is associated primarily with computers taking liquidity. This result is consistent with the view that AT improves informational efficiency by speeding up price discovery, but that it may also impose higher adverse selection costs on slower traders. In contrast, the reduction in the autocorrelation of returns owes more to the algorithmic provision of liquidity. We also find evidence consistent with the strategies of algorithmic traders being highly correlated. This correlation, however, does not appear to cause a degradation in market quality, at least not on average."
552,Rising incidence of ageing opioid users within the EU wide treatment demand indicator; The Irish opioid epidemic from 1996 to 2014,A. Carew;C. Comiskey,Drug and Alcohol Dependence,"Literature identifies older people who use opioids as a neglected population. Little is known about temporal changes, or about treatment demand among this population.The EU Treatment Demand Indicator (TDI) for Ireland (1996–2014) was analyzed for trends in new opioid treatment admissions, ageing and drug using behaviors. A Joinpoint analysis was conducted.Data from 18,692 individuals entering treatment for the first time showed that while the trend of age-adjusted incidence declined between 1996 and 2014, incidence among older age groups increased, with a rising incidence not previously observed among those aged 50 years and older. Subgroups of early and late treatment entries, and early and late opioid onset were observed. The median age commencing opioid use increased by three years from 18 to 21 years (U = 326141.5, p &lt; 0.001). The median age entering treatment increased by 11 years (from age 20 to age 31) (U = 145465.5, p &lt; 0.001). The median opioid-using duration prior to treatment increased by 5 years (from 2 to 7 years) (U = 170807.5, p &lt; 0.001). Half of the individuals started injecting within one year of first using opioids. The median time between first injecting and commencing treatment increased by 6 years for men and 2 years for women.The study utilizes European TDI data and finds that those entering treatment in Ireland is older, are injecting longer and are taking longer to enter treatment. These findings highlight how TDI data can be used to identify hidden groups at risk of chronic harm which may require prioritizing in policy and practice."
553,Robust stabilization of discrete-time jump linear systems with multiplicative noise,A. Bouhtouri;K. Hadri,IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information,"This paper deals with the robustness of a class of discrete-time jump linear systems whose parameters are governed by a finite-state Markov chain and subject to piecewise deterministic and stochastic structured uncertainties. We establish that the exponential stability of this class is equivalent to the exponential stability of an associated class of discrete-time linear systems with no jumping parameters and subject to block diagonal deterministic and stochastic structured uncertainties. This key result is used to propose lower bounds for what we define as the stability radii with respect to this class of perturbation structures. The optimization problem of the stability radii that can be achieved by dynamic output feedback is also discussed and sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of stabilizing compensator which ensures that the stability radius is above a given level, via the resolution of parameterized matrix inequalities."

Hadri,IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information,"This paper deals with the robustness of stability and stabilization problem for a class of jump linear systems with Markov jumping parameters and subject to piecewise deterministic and stochastic uncertainties. We prove that the exponential stability of these systems is equivalent to exponential stability of associated linear Itô systems with no jumping parameters subject to structured block‐diagonal multi‐perturbations. This result is exploited to give lower bounds for what we define as the stability radii of this type of systems, via the resolution of parametrized linear matrix inequalities. The optimization problem by output feedback is also addressed. Sufficient conditions are presented for the existence of a stabilizing dynamic full‐order controller, which ensure that the closed‐loop system has a stability radius greater than some pre‐specified bound, and a procedure for the construction of stabilizing compensator is proposed via the resolution of a number of linear matrix inequalities. The paper ends with a brief discussion of the state feedback case."

557,Role of W-ino content in neutralino dark matter,A. Birkedal-Hansen;B. Nelson,Physical Review D,"We investigate the dark matter prospects of supersymmetric models with nonuniversal gaugino masses at low values of tanβ. We find that for particular values of the ratio of soft supersymmetry-breaking gaugino masses, M2/M1, an enhanced coannihilation efficiency between the lightest chargino and the lightest neutralino occurs. As a specific example, we investigate models of hidden sector gaugino condensation. These models exhibit high scalar masses and the requisite freedom in the ratio of gaugino masses. The cosmologically viable regions of parameter space are investigated, allowing very specific statements to be made about the content of the supersymmetry-breaking hidden sector."
558,Role of aromatic amino acid tryptophan UVA-photoproducts in the determination of drug photosensitization mechanism: a comparison between methylene blue and naproxen,A. Catalfo;G. Bracchitta;G. Guidi,Photochemical and Photobiological Sciences,"The aromatic amino acid tryptophan is the most susceptible protein residue involved in various photosensitized adverse effects. Of these processes, the tryptophan photosensitization induced by methylene blue has been well studied. A predominant type II photosensitizing activity, mediated by singlet oxygen, has been already demonstrated on various models. The purpose of this study is to compare this photosensitization system with that induced by naproxen, belonging to the class of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. For this compound, a type I (radical) and type II (singlet oxygen) cooperative mechanism of photoinduced damage was previously proposed. This study represents an example of testing drugs on the simple experimental model of amino acid residues in proteins. Particular emphasis is dedicated to modifications caused by the formation of drug photomediated toxic species, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). This is achieved following the kinetics of photodegradation of the sensitizers and of the amino acid, as well as the formation of their photoproducts and by evaluation of quantum yields of the various processes. Tryptophan photoproducts represent biomarkers of oxidative damage indicative for protein photooxidation and for the molecular mechanism of photosensitization; some of these have been identified for the first time as UVA photosensitization products. The pattern of Trp photoproducts formed by the two compounds differs and is specific for each type of sensitization process. These observations support extending the investigation to systems of increasing molecular complexity, that is Trp in isolated proteins and in cells and represent an effort to provide a simplified rationale of the complex picture coming out from literature data and our experimental results."
559,Role of matrix metalloprotease-9 in hyperoxic injury in developing lung,A. Chetty;G. Cao;M. Severgnini;A. Simon;R. Warburton;H. Nielsen,American Journal of Physiology - Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology,"Matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) is increased in lung injury following hyperoxia exposure in neonatal mice, in association with impaired alveolar development. We studied the role of MMP-9 in the mechanism of hyperoxia-induced functional and histological changes in neonatal mouse lung. Reduced alveolarization with remodeling of ECM is a major morbidity component of oxidant injury in developing lung. MMP-9 mediates oxidant injury in developing lung causing altered lung remodeling. Five-day-old neonatal wild-type (WT) and MMP-9 (−/−) mice were exposed to hyperoxia for 8 days. The lungs were inflation fixed, and sections were examined for morphometry. The mean linear intercept and alveolar counts were evaluated. Immunohistochemistry for MMP-9 and elastin was performed. MMP-2, MMP-9, type I collagen, and tropoelastin were measured by Western blot analysis. Lung quasistatic compliance was studied in anaesthetized mice. MMP-2 and MMP-9 were significantly increased in lungs of WT mice exposed to hyperoxia compared with controls. Immunohistochemistry showed an increase in MMP-9 in mesenchyme and alveolar epithelium of hyperoxic lungs. The lungs of hyperoxia-exposed WT mice had less gas exchange surface area and were less compliant compared with room air-exposed WT and hyperoxia-exposed MMP-9 (−/−) mice. Type I collagen and tropoelastin were increased in hyperoxia-exposed WT with aberrant elastin staining. These changes were ameliorated in hyperoxia-exposed MMP-9 (−/−) mice. MMP-9 plays an important role in the structural changes consequent to oxygen-induced lung injury. Blocking MMP-9 activity may lead to novel therapeutic approaches in preventing bronchopulmonary dysplasia."
560,Role of sex hormone-binding globulin in the relationship between sex hormones and antisocial and aggressive personality in inmates,A. Aluja;L. García,Psychiatry Research,"Plasma total testosterone (TT), free bioavailable testosterone (BT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHGB), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were analysed in a sample of 89 inmates. Also, the tendency towards an Antisocial Personality Disorder (AAPS) and Aggressiveness (based on an index containing three scales of the Buss–Durkee Hostility Inventory; BDHI) was assessed. Results showed strong correlations between SHBG, total testosterone and free bioavailable testosterone. SHBG and total testosterone correlated with Aggressiveness (0.39 and 0.29, respectively), though the latter turned out not to be significant when SHBG level was controlled. The group with a high probability of Antisocial Personality Disorder and the group with high scores in Aggressiveness obtained higher SHBG levels. Recidivists and subjects already sentenced presented higher concentrations of SHBG. No significant relation was found for the free bioavailable testosterone. It is argued that the relationship between testosterone and antisocial personality and aggressiveness is mediated by the role of SHBG. We conclude that subjects with a disinhibited life-style tend to abuse intoxicants affecting the production of SHBG in the liver. This effect is observed in healthy subjects and delinquents, but more strongly in the population of delinquents."
561,Rosetta following a living comet,A. Accomazzo;P. Ferri;S. Lodiot;J. Pellon-Bailon;T. Francisco,Acta Astronautica,"The International Rosetta Mission was launched on 2nd March 2004 on its 10 year journey to rendezvous with comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Rosetta performed comet orbit insertion on the 6th of August 2014, after which it characterised the nucleus and orbited it at altitudes as low as a few kilometres. In November 2014 Rosetta delivered the lander Philae to perform the first soft landing ever on the surface of a comet. The critical landing operations have been conducted with remarkable accuracy and will constitute one of the most important achievements in the history of spaceflight.After this critical operation, Rosetta began the escort phase of the comet in its journey in the Solar System heading to the perihelion, reached in August 2015. Throughout this period, the comet environment kept changing with increasing gas and dust emissions. A first phase of bound orbits was followed by a sequence of complex flyby segments which allowed the scientific instruments to perform in depth investigation of the comet environment and nucleus. The unpredictable nature of the comet activity forced the mission control team to implement unplanned changes to the flight plan prepared for this mission phase and to plan the whole mission in a more dynamic way than originally conceived.This paper describes the details of the landing operations and of the main comet escort phase. It also includes the mission status as achieved after perihelion and the findings about the evolution of the comet and its environment from a mission operations point of view. The lessons learned from this unique and complex operations phase and the plans for the next mission phases, which include a mission extension into 2016, are also described."
562,Rosetta mission operations for landing,A. Accomazzo;S. Lodiot;V. Companys,Acta Astronautica,"The International Rosetta Mission of the European Space Agency (ESA) was launched on 2nd March 2004 on its 10 year journey to comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko and has reached it early August 2014. The main mission objectives were to perform close observations of the comet nucleus throughout its orbit around the Sun and deliver the lander Philae to its surface. This paper describers the activities at mission operations level that allowed the landing of Philae.The landing preparation phase was mainly characterised by the definition of the landing selection process, to which several parties contributed, and by the definition of the strategy for comet characterisation, the orbital strategy for lander delivery, and the definition and validation of the operations timeline.The definition of the landing site selection process involved almost all components of the mission team; Rosetta has been the first, and so far only mission, that could not rely on data collected by previous missions for the landing site selection. This forced the teams to include an intensive observation campaign as a mandatory part of the process; several science teams actively contributed to this campaign thus making results from science observations part of the mandatory operational products. The time allocated to the comet characterisation phase was in the order of a few weeks and all the processes, tools, and interfaces required an extensive planning an validation. Being the descent of Philae purely ballistic, the main driver for the orbital strategy was the capability to accurately control the position and velocity of Rosetta at Philae’s separation. The resulting operations timeline had to merge this need of frequent orbit determination and control with the complexity of the ground segment and the inherent risk of problems when doing critical activities in short times.This paper describes the contribution of the Mission Control Centre (MOC) at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) to this mission phase and the lessons learned that can be derived from this experience."
563,Rosetta operations at the comet,A. Accomazzo;P. Ferri;S. Lodiot;J. Pellon-Bailon;T. Francisco,Acta Astronautica,"The International Rosetta Mission was launched on 2nd March 2004 on its 10 year journey to comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko and has reached it early August 2014; it will now orbit it for about 1.5 years down to distances of a few kilometres and has delivered the Lander Philae onto its surface.Following the exit in January 2014 from a 2.5 years hibernation period, necessary due to the large heliocentric distances reached by the solar-powered spacecraft, which prevented full operation of the on-board electrical systems, Rosetta conducted the delicate approach phase during which it slowly discovered its unexpected irregular shape. The spacecraft is now flying in close proximity of the comet and has begun its main science phase. The comet has been characterised to the level necessary to perform a proper orbit insertion and proceed with the global mapping and close observation phases. During this phase the landing site for Philae has been selected with all operations focusing on this extremely delicate and risky mission phase. The mission has been conducted according to plan and the planning and operations concepts defined have revealed to be adequate for the environment encountered during the early comet phases. The performance of the spacecraft and of the whole operations teams have been very good; all the tools and processes developed to characterise and model the environment revealed to be adequate and provided results that are fully in line with the needs.This paper describes the flight operations conducted till November 2014, the results and the performance of the mission from an operations point of view, and some of the details of the landing phase. Finally it also addresses the lessons learned that can be drawn after this initial phase of comet operations."
564,Rosetta visits asteroid (21)Lutetia,A. Accomazzo;P. Ferri;A. Hubault;S. Lodiot;R. Porta,Acta Astronautica,"The International Rosetta Mission, cornerstone of the European Space Agency Scientific Programme, was launched on 2nd March 2004 to its 10 years journey to comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko. Rosetta will reach the comet in summer 2014, orbit it for about 1.5 years down to distances of a few Kilometres and deliver the Lander Philae onto its surface. After its successful asteroid fly-by in September 2008, Rosetta came back to Earth, for the final gravity acceleration towards its longest heliocentric orbit, up to a distance of 5.3 AU. It is during this phase that Rosetta crossed for the second time the main asteroids belt and performed a close encounter with asteroid (21)Lutetia on the 10th of July 2010 at a distance of ca. 3160 km and a relative velocity of 15 km/s. The payload complement of the spacecraft was activated to perform highly valuable scientific observations. The approach phase to the celestial body required a careful and accurate optical navigation campaign that will prove to be useful also for the comet approach phase. The experience gained with first asteroid flyby in 2008 was fed back into the operations definition and preparation for this highly critical phase; this concerns in particular the operations of the navigation camera for the close-loop autonomous asteroid tracking and of the main scientific camera for high resolution imaging. It was shortly after the flyby that Rosetta became the solar-powered spacecraft to have flown furthest from the Sun (&gt;2.72 AU). This paper presents the activities carried out and planned for the definition, preparation and implementation of the asteroid flyby mission operations, including the test campaign conducted to improve the performance of the spacecraft and payload compared to the previous flyby. The results of the flyby itself are presented, with the operations implemented, the achieved performance and the lessons learned."
565,Rufloxacin induced photosensitization in bio-models of increasing complexity,A. Catalfo;C. Scifo;S. Stella;A. Belvedere;M. Renis;G. Guidi,Photochemical and Photobiological Sciences,"Rufloxacin belongs to the class of fluoroquinolones that act mainly as specific inhibitors of bacterial Topoisomerase II. These drugs are widely known to be involved in various diseases ranging from cutaneous reactions to aging. The type II photosensitizing activity of Rufloxacin has been already demonstrated on calf thymus DNA and free nucleosides. The aim of this study is to examine in control untreated and UVA irradiated human fibroblasts the modifications on DNA status induced by Rufloxacin added in the culture medium. This allows to investigate the photosensitizing activity of Rufloxacin in a more complex cell model. Fibroblasts, either in the presence or in the absence of Rufloxacin, were exposed to UVA irradiation for different times. An experimental protocol was followed in order to evaluate the amount of single-strand breaks (SSB) and double-strand breaks (DSB) DNA fragmentation by comet assay, and plasmid photocleavage. The presence of oxidized bases was also evaluated using the 8-OH-dGuo test. The comet assay test was also employed to assess cellular repair capacity. The intracellular drug concentration was verified by HPLC-MS. The results confirming the role of Rufloxacin as photosensitizer were: (i) a time-dependent increase in DNA fragmentation when fibroblasts were irradiated in the presence of Rufloxacin; (ii) the efficiency of the cellular repair machinery to be exhaustive after 2 h (whereas no correlation between irradiation time and DNA damage repair was observed with a higher level of DNA fragmentation after shorter irradiation times); (iii) the increased number of cells exhibiting high DNA fragmentation, seen as comets with long tails, was not accompanied by a similar large extent of oxidised DNA base formation, as measured by 8-OH-dGuo analysis; (iv) the double helix SSB, formed in plasmid photosensitization, agreed with the comet assay results, pointing out a good correlation among the cell system and the simpler models used."
566,Rufloxacin-induced photosensitization in yeast,A. Catalfo;M. Calandra;M. Renis;M. Serrentino;G. Guidi,Photochemical and Photobiological Sciences,"The fluoroquinolone Rufloxacin (RFX) is active as specific inhibitor of bacterial gyrase. The adverse effects of the photosensitization induced by fluoroquinolones are well known. A predominant type II photosensitizing activity of Rufloxacin has already been demonstrated on simpler models (free nucleosides, calf thymus DNA), whereas a cooperative mechanism was corroborated on more complex ones (plasmid and fibroblast). The purpose of this study is to examine the drug photocytoxicity in another complex cellular model, a wild-type eukaryotic fast-growing microorganism whose cultivation is cheap and easily managed, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This work represents the first report of the potential photogenotoxicity of Rufloxacin. Particular emphasis was given to DNA modifications caused in yeast by the formation of Rufloxacin photomediated toxic species, such as hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde. Drug phototoxicity on yeast was evaluated by measuring DNA fragmentation (single/double strand breaks) using single cell gel electrophoresis assay and 8-OH-dGuo, a DNA photooxidationbiomarker, by HPLC-ECD. Cellular sensitivity was also assessed by cell viability test. The extra- and intracellularRFX concentration (as well as its main photoproduct) was verified by HPLC-MS, whereas the cytotoxic species were evaluated by colorimetric assays. The results confirm the phototoxicity of Rufloxacin on yeast cell and are in agreement with those previously obtained with human fibroblast and with simpler models used recently, and provide a clear link between DNA photosensitization and overall phototoxicity."

Guanidinium is the intrinsic probe that drives the orientation of the peptide onto the silver surface. Molecular mechanics and extended Hückel calculations of a model of MRKDV interacting with a silver surface support the experimental results. MD calculations representing the evolution of the peptide toward a model membrane were also performed. The guanidinium moiety interacts with the phospholipidic membrane surface.

569,SLO BK Potassium Channels Couple Gap Junctions to Inhibition of Calcium Signaling in Olfactory Neuron Diversification,A. Alqadah;Y. Hsieh;J. Schumacher;X. Wang;S. Merrill;G. Millington;B. Bayne;E. Jorgensen;C. Chuang,PLOS Genetics,"The C. elegans AWC olfactory neuron pair communicates to specify asymmetric subtypes AWCOFF and AWCON in a stochastic manner. Intercellular communication between AWC and other neurons in a transient NSY-5 gap junction network antagonizes voltage-activated calcium channels, UNC-2 (CaV2) and EGL-19 (CaV1), in the AWCON cell, but how calcium signaling is downregulated by NSY-5 is only partly understood. Here, we show that voltage- and calcium-activated SLO BK potassium channels mediate gap junction signaling to inhibit calcium pathways for asymmetric AWC differentiation. Activation of vertebrate SLO-1 channels causes transient membrane hyperpolarization, which makes it an important negative feedback system for calcium entry through voltage-activated calcium channels. Consistent with the physiological roles of SLO-1, our genetic results suggest that slo-1 BK channels act downstream of NSY-5 gap junctions to inhibit calcium channel-mediated signaling in the specification of AWCON. We also show for the first time that slo-2 BK channels are important for AWC asymmetry and act redundantly with slo-1 to inhibit calcium signaling. In addition, nsy-5-dependent asymmetric expression of slo-1 and slo-2 in the AWCON neuron is necessary and sufficient for AWC asymmetry. SLO-1 and SLO-2 localize close to UNC-2 and EGL-19 in AWC, suggesting a role of possible functional coupling between SLO BK channels and voltage-activated calcium channels in AWC asymmetry. Furthermore, slo-1 and slo-2 regulate the localization of synaptic markers, UNC-2 and RAB-3, in AWC neurons to control AWC asymmetry. We also identify the requirement of bkip-1, which encodes a previously identified auxiliary subunit of SLO-1, for slo-1 and slo-2 function in AWC asymmetry. Together, these results provide an unprecedented molecular link between gap junctions and calcium pathways for terminal differentiation of olfactory neurons."
570,SPROUTY-2 and E-cadherin regulate reciprocally and dictate colon cancer cell tumourigenicity,A. Barbáchano;P. Ordóñez-Morán;J. García;A. Sánchez;F. Pereira;M. Larriba;N. Martínez;J. Hernández;S. Landolfi;F. Bonilla;H. Pálmer;J. Rojas;A. Muñoz,Oncogene,"SPROUTY-2 (SPRY2) regulates receptor tyrosine kinase signalling and therefore cell growth and differentiation. In this study, we show that SPRY2 expression in colon cancer cells is inhibited by the active vitamin D metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) through E-cadherin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In turn, SPRY2 represses both basal and 1,25(OH)2D3-induced E-cadherin expression. In line with this, SPRY2 induces ZEB1 RNA and protein, but not that of other epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition inducers that repress the CDH1/E-cadherin promoter. Consistently, SPRY2 and E-cadherin protein levels inversely correlate in colon cancer cell lines and xenografted tumours. Moreover, SPRY2 knockdown by small hairpin RNA increases CDH1/E-cadherin expression and, reciprocally, CDH1/E-cadherin knockdown increases that of SPRY2. In colon cancer patients, SPRY2 is upregulated in undifferentiated high-grade tumours and at the invasive front of low-grade carcinomas. Quantification of protein expression in 34 tumours confirmed an inverse correlation between SPRY2 and E-cadherin. Our data demonstrate a tumourigenic action of SPRY2 that is based on the repression of E-cadherin, probably by the induction of ZEB1, and a reciprocal regulation of SPRY2 and E-cadherin that dictates cell phenotype. We propose SPRY2 as a candidate novel marker for high-grade tumours and a target of therapeutic intervention in colon cancer.SPROUTY-2 (SPRY2) regulates receptor tyrosine kinase signalling and therefore cell growth and differentiation. In this study, we show that SPRY2 expression in colon cancer cells is inhibited by the active vitamin D metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) through E-cadherin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In turn, SPRY2 represses both basal and 1,25(OH)2D3-induced E-cadherin expression. In line with this, SPRY2 induces ZEB1 RNA and protein, but not that of other epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition inducers that repress the CDH1/E-cadherin promoter. Consistently, SPRY2 and E-cadherin protein levels inversely correlate in colon cancer cell lines and xenografted tumours. Moreover, SPRY2 knockdown by small hairpin RNA increases CDH1/E-cadherin expression and, reciprocally, CDH1/E-cadherin knockdown increases that of SPRY2. In colon cancer patients, SPRY2 is upregulated in undifferentiated high-grade tumours and at the invasive front of low-grade carcinomas.

571,SPROUTY-2 represses the epithelial phenotype of colon carcinoma cells via upregulation of ZEB1 mediated by ETS1 and miR-200/miR-150,A. Barbáchano;A. Fernández-Barral;F. Pereira;M. Segura;P. Ordóñez-Morán;E. Pau;J. González-Sancho;D. Hanniford;N. Martínez;A. Costales-Carrera;F. Real;H. Pálmer;J. Rojas;E. Hernando;A. Muñoz,Oncogene,"SPROUTY-2 (SPRY2) is a modulator of tyrosine kinase receptor signaling with receptor- and cell type-dependent inhibitory or enhancing effects. Studies on the action of SPRY2 in major cancers are conflicting and its role remains unclear. Here we have dissected SPRY2 action in human colon cancer. Global transcriptomic analyses show that SPRY2 downregulates genes encoding tight junction proteins such as claudin-7 and occludin and other cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion molecules in human SW480-ADH colon carcinoma cells. Moreover, SPRY2 represses LLGL2/HUGL2, PATJ1/INADL and ST14, main regulators of the polarized epithelial phenotype, and ESRP1, an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inhibitor. A key action of SPRY2 is the upregulation of the major EMT inducer ZEB1, as these effects are reversed by ZEB1 knock-down by means of RNA interference. Consistently, we found an inverse correlation between the expression level of claudin-7 and those of SPRY2 and ZEB1 in human colon tumors. Mechanistically, ZEB1 upregulation by SPRY2 results from the combined induction of ETS1 transcription factor and the repression of microRNAs (miR-200 family, miR-150) that target ZEB1 RNA. Moreover, SPRY2 increased AKT activation by epidermal growth factor, whereas AKT and also Src inhibition reduced the induction of ZEB1. Altogether, these data suggest that AKT and Src are implicated in SPRY2 action. Collectively, these results show a tumorigenic role of SPRY2 in colon cancer that is based on the dysregulation of tight junction and epithelial polarity master genes via upregulation of ZEB1. The dissection of the mechanism of action of SPRY2 in colon cancer cells is important to understand the upregulation of this gene in a subset of patients with this neoplasia that have poor prognosis.SPROUTY-2 (SPRY2) is a modulator of tyrosine kinase receptor signaling with receptor- and cell type-dependent inhibitory or enhancing effects.

572,SU‐D‐206‐05: A Critical Look at CBCT‐Based Dose Calculation Accuracy as It Is Applied to Adaptive Radiotherapy,A. Buele;N. Sperling;E. Parsai,Medical Physics,"Purpose: Cone‐beam CTs (CBCT) obtained from On‐Board Imaging Devices (OBI) are increasingly being used for dose calculation purposes in adaptive radiotherapy. Patient and target morphology are monitored and the treatment plan is updated using CBCT. Due to the difference in image acquisition parameters, dose calculated in a CBCT can differ from planned dose. We evaluate the difference between dose calculation in kV CBCT and simulation CT, and the effect of HU‐density tables in dose discrepancies Methods: HU values for various materials were obtained using a Catphan 504 phantom for a simulator CT (CTSIM) and two different OBI systems using three imaging protocols: Head, Thorax and Pelvis. HU‐density tables were created in the TPS for each OBI image protocol. Treatment plans were made on each Catphan 504 dataset and on the head, thorax and pelvis sections of an anthropomorphic phantom, with and without the respective HU‐density table. DVH information was compared among OBI systems and planning CT. Results: Dose calculations carried on the Catphan 504 CBCTs, with and without the respective CT‐density table, had a maximum difference of −0.65% from the values on the planning CT. The use of the respective HU‐density table decreased the percent differences from planned values by half in most of the protocols. For the anthropomorphic phantom datasets, the use of the correct HU‐density table reduced differences by 0.89% on OBI1 and 0.59% on OBI2 for the head, 0.49% on OBI1 for the thorax, and 0.25% on OBI2 for the pelvis. Differences from planned values without HU‐density correction ranged from 3.13% (OBI1, thorax) to 0.30% (OBI2, thorax). Conclusion: CT‐density tables in the TPS yield acceptable differences when used in partly homogeneous medium. Further corrections are needed when the medium contains pronounced density differences for accurate CBCT calculation. Current difference range (1–3%) can be clinically acceptable."
573,SU‐E‐T‐489: Incorporating Skin Flash Into VMAT WBI: Impacts On Surface Dosimetry,A. Buele;S. Tanny;G. Warrell;E. Parsai,Medical Physics,"Purpose: Increased use of inverse planning limits the amount of skin flash in whole breast irradiation (WBI). Strategies to incorporate flash into inverse‐planned treatments involve overriding air to the density of water or tissue. This introduces uncertainties to the superficial dose distribution, potentially degrading the coverage at the skin‐bolus interface. We investigate the accuracy of various commonly used bolus materials to incorporate flash in VMAT WBI plans while minimizing the perturbation near the skin. Methods: We obtained a CT‐simulation of an anthropomorphic phantom with a breast attachment. Three VMAT plans were created with different boluses: 1 cm of 1 g/cm3 bolus (Superflab), 1 cm of 0.65 g/cm3 bolus (wet towels), and 1 cm of g/cm3 bolus with 2 dose levels accounting for the difference between bolus and tissue density. The PTV was extended into the bolus, outside the patient body contour to incorporate flash. OSLDs were used to obtain surface doses at the medial, lateral and tip sites of the breast. Each plan was irradiated four times using CBCT for positioning and dosimeter localization. Results: The average thickness of the wet‐towel bolus on delivery was 8 mm with a CBCT‐measured density of 0.6 g/cm3. OSLD measurements demonstrated good agreement with predicted doses from Pinnacle. Average deviations were −5.7%, −2.5%, and −2.6% for plans 1, 2, and 3, respectively. OSLDs placed at the medial and lateral portions of the breast showed the largest average deviations. The maximum recorded deviation from planned values was −8.6%. The largest dose fluctuations occurred near areas where the bolus failed to properly conform to the breast contour. Conclusion: Use of wet‐towel bolus improved dose delivery accuracy compared to standard Superflab bolus. Areas of poor bolus conformity adversely affected dose delivery. We recommend the use of wet‐towel bolus over Superflab bolus for VMAT WBI."
574,SU‐FF‐I‐78: Effective Doses in Whole Body and Brain PET/CT Procedures of Adult Patients,A. Al‐Haj;A. Lobriguito;R. Parker,Medical Physics,"Purpose: To determine the variation in patient effective doses for whole body and brain PET‐CT procedures and determine methods for dose optimization. Method and Materials: Demographic data (age, gender, and weight), CT exposure parameters and activity of 18F (FDG) were taken from patient records of 543 whole body and initial 54 brain PET/CT cases. PET Effective doses were estimated using the dose conversion coefficients for 18F (FDG) in ICRP Report No. 80. CT effective doses for the manufacturer's stated CTDIair were estimated using the IMPACT dose calculator. The Pearson correlation (p <0.0001) of PET effective doses with weight, age and 18F (FDG) activity was analyzed. Results: There are more male patients (55% and 61%) than females (45% and 39%) for whole body and brain procedures respectively. The mean age of patients for whole body is 47 ±18 years old and 34 ±16 years old for brain studies. The mean 18F (FDG) for whole body is 460 ± 130 MBq and 410 ± 45 Mbq for brain procedures. Pooling all ages, the mean effective doses are 8 ± 2 mSv and 10 ± 1mSv for whole body and brain respectively and dose correlate poorly with weight, age and activity. CT effective doses are in the range of 11 to 15 Msv. Conclusion: There is a wide variation in the 18F(FDG) activity which is about 30% of the mean activity. Standardization of activity can be formulated per weight or per age and a study of the setting image quality criteria and using low dose CT should be made. A dose conversion coefficient of 1.8 Msv per Gy can be used for whole body CT using 6 and 9 mGy CTDI to estimate effective dose."
575,SU‐F‐I‐35: Establishment of DRL and Dose Indicators for Optimization of Protectionin Pediatric CT in Saudi Arabia,A. Al‐Haj;A. Lobriguito,Medical Physics,"Purpose: To establish the national dose reference level for pediatric CT procedures in Saudi Arabia. It also aims to determine dose indicators that can be used for optimization of protection. Methods: A retrospective study of patient demographic data, CT exposure parameters and dose indicators in DLP and CTDI volume for pediatric patients was undertaken. The CT procedures were chest, brain and abdomen. A total of 550 patients from 5 medical centers were included in the study. The patients were grouped into age groups of 0–1, 1–5, 5–10 and 10–15 years old. The dose reference levels for each procedure were determined using the 75 percentile of all the recorded DLP values. The effective dose for each age group was estimated from the mean DLP per procedure. A dose conversion coefficient in effective dose per DLP for each age group per procedure was derived. Normalization of the mAs and CTD1 volume was done and analyzed for evaluating dose optimization. Results: The DLP values vary from center to center for different age groups for the same procedure by a factor of about 2 to 4. Pooling all age categories, the DPL values are 42–400 mGy cm for chest, 500–1,900 mGy cm for brain and 40–850 mGy cm for abdomen. One of the factors that gave the high variation is the use of the adult protocol for some age groups especially for ages greater than 10. The effective dose of chest for 0 to 1 years old is higher than the 5 to 10 years by about 8percent. Conclusion: The use of the DRL values, effective dose and dose conversion coefficient for each procedure are best indicators for procedures that need optimization of protection. There is a need to formulate a national guideline on the use of DRL for pediatric CT procedures."
576,SU‐F‐T‐520: Dosimetric Comparison of Radiation Treatment Plans for Whole Breast Irradiation Between 3D Conformal in Prone and Supine Positions Vs. VMAT and IMRT in Supine Positions,A. Buele;E. Parsai,Medical Physics,"Purpose: The target volume for Whole Breast Irradiation (WBI) is dictated by location of tumor mass, breast tissue distribution, and involvement of lymph nodes. Dose coverage and Organs at Risk (OARs) sparing can be difficult to achieve in patients with unfavorable thoracic geometries. For these cases, inverse‐planned and 3D‐conformal prone treatments can be alternatives to traditional supine 3D‐conformal plans. A dosimetric comparison can determine which of these techniques achieve optimal target coverage while sparing OARs. Methods: This study included simulation datasets for 8 patients, 5 of whom were simulated in both supine and prone positions. Positioning devices included breast boards and Vaclok bags for the supine position, and prone breast boards for the prone position. WBI 3‐D conformal plans were created for patients simulated in both positions. Additional VMAT and IMRT WBI plans were made for all patients in the supine position. Results: Prone and supine 3D conformal plans had comparable PTV coverage. Prone 3D conformal plans received a significant 50% decrease to V20, V10, V5 and V30% for the ipsilateral lung in contrast to the supine plans. The heart also experienced a 10% decrease in maximum dose in the prone position, and V20, V10, V5 and V2 had significantly lower values than the supine plan. Supine IMRT and VMAT breast plans obtained comparable PTV coverage. The heart experienced a 10% decrease in maximum dose with inverse modulated plans when compared to the supine 3D conformal plan, while V20, V10, V5 and V2 showed higher values with inverse modulated plans than with supine 3D conformal plans. Conclusion: Prone 3D‐conformal, and supine inverse planned treatments were generally superior in sparing OARs to supine plans with comparable PTV coverage. IMRT and VMAT plans offer sparing of OARs from high dose regions with an increase of irradiated volume in the low dose regions."
577,Salted cod manufacturing: influence of salting procedure on process yield and product characteristics,A. Andrés;S. Rodríguez-Barona;J. Barat;P. Fito,Journal of Food Engineering,"Cod (Gadus morhua L.) is a white fish that man has been traditionally using for his feeding. In the Mediterranean countries, it is commercialized mainly as salted cod with different moisture content depending on the extension of the drying step. Different salting methods can be used for cod salting (kench salting, pickling and brining) and the comparison of the final product characteristics could help to evaluate the process and to understand the different mass transfer mechanisms involved. In this work, four salting methods were used to manufacture salted cod, completing the process with the corresponding drying, desalting and cooking steps. The aim of the study was to analyze the influence of the salting method on the following steps of the manufacturing process. The results obtained showed significant differences (α &lt; 0.05) on the yield of the process mainly due to differences in the amount of liquid phase in the muscle. In spite of these yield differences the quality attributes of cooked product were similar in all cases."
578,Same difference: Transdisciplinary concepts and skills in artistic practice to minimise communication breakdown in art practice when misusing a common language,A. Arthurs,Contemporary Music Review,"Our ears are not isolated from our other senses, but work in conjunction with them to maximise our chance of survival and to make sense of our world. However, the growth of specialisation in artistic practice and theory means that disciplinary-specific practices have, over time, tended toward silos, isolating themselves from each other by their specialist training institutions, funding bodies and artistic and industrial practices. The advantage of separation was to enable the analysis of structures and form through particular lenses or frameworks, and to create highly specialised ‘experts’ in areas such as visual arts, dance, drama and music. This ensured high quality within that paradigm, but, in an era of convergence in which we now find ourselves, new phenomena arise, one being the transdisciplinary musician. For such an approach, fresh concepts emerge, and new skill-sets and techniques are needed. This article attempts to identify some of these."

We review all details of the model pertinent to a relic density calculation. We perform a thermal relic density calculation including couplings to the gauge and Higgs sectors of the model. We find two regions of parameter space that give acceptable dark matter abundances. The first region has a dark matter candidate with a mass O(100GeV), the second region has a candidate with a mass greater than O(500GeV). The dark matter candidate in either region is an admixture of an SU(2) triplet and an SU(2) singlet, thereby constituting a possible weakly interacting massive particle."
580,Scale-up production of vitamin loaded heteroprotein coacervates and their protective property,A. Chapeau;P. Hamon;F. Rousseau;T. Croguennec;S. Bouhallab,Journal of Food Engineering,"The production of biocarriers for the protection and controlled delivery of bioactives is of great interest to develop functional foods. The ability of two whey proteins (WP), Beta-Lactoglobulin (BLG) and Lactoferrin (LF), to efficiently entrap vitamin B9 by complex coacervation has been reported at laboratory scale. In the present work, we report on the scaling-up production of B9 loaded BLG-LF coacervates (B9-WP coacervates). Complex coacervation was performed at bench scale, using commercial protein solutions. Under optimized conditions, B9-WP coacervates were produced by static mixing at a flow rate of 300 mL/min. Bench scale efficiency similar to that found for laboratory scale was reached with a coacervation yield of 65% and the B9 entrapment of 98%, demonstrating an efficient scaling-up. B9-WP coacervates showed good protection property for B9 during storage treatments, confirming the efficiency of this type of biocarrier for the development of natural functional foods."
581,Scaling exponents of rough surfaces generated by the Domany-Kinzel cellular automaton,A. Atman;R. Dickman;J. Moreira,Physical Review E,"The critical behavior at the frozen-active transition in the Domany-Kinzel stochastic cellular automaton is studied via a surface growth process in (1+1) dimensions. At criticality, this process presents a kinetic roughening transition; we measure the critical exponents in simulations. Two update schemes are considered: in the symmetric scheme, the growth surfaces belong to the directed percolation (DP) universality class, except at one terminal point. At this point, the phase transition is discontinuous and the surfaces belong to the compact directed percolation universality class. The relabeling of space-time points in the nonsymmetric scheme alters significantly the surface growth, changing the values of the critical exponents. The critical behavior of rough surfaces at the nonchaotic-chaotic transition is also studied using the damage spreading technique; the exponents confirm DP values for the symmetric scheme."
582,SecSens: Secure State Estimation with Application to Localization and Time Synchronization,A. Alanwar;B. Etzlinger;H. Ferraz;J. Hespanha;M. Srivastava,ArXiv Computer Science,"Research evidence in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) shows that the introduced tight coupling of information technology with physical sensing and actuation leads to more vulnerability and security weaknesses. But, the traditional security protection mechanisms of CPS focus on data encryption while neglecting the sensors which are vulnerable to attacks in the physical domain. Accordingly, researchers attach utmost importance to the problem of state estimation in the presence of sensor attacks. In this work, we present SecSens, a novel approach for secure nonlinear state estimation in the presence of modeling and measurement noise. SecSens consists of two independent algorithms, namely, SecEKF and SecOPT, which are based on Extended Kalman Filter and Maximum Likelihood Estimation, respectively. We adopt a holistic approach to introduce security awareness among state estimation algorithms without requiring specialized hardware, or cryptographic techniques. We apply SecSens to securely localize and time synchronize networked mobile devices. SecSens provides good performance at run-time several order of magnitude faster than the state of art solutions under the presence of powerful attacks. Our algorithms are evaluated on a testbed with static nodes and a mobile quadrotor all equipped with commercial ultra-wide band wireless devices."
583,Secondary Air System Component Modeling for Engine Performance Simulations,A. Alexiou;K. Mathioudakis,Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power,"This paper describes the modeling of typical secondary air system elements such as rotating orifices, seals, and flow passages with heat and work transfer from the surrounding surfaces. The modeling is carried out in an object-oriented simulation environment that allows the creation of different configurations in a simple and flexible manner. This makes possible to compare the performance between different designs of individual components or complete secondary air systems as well as integrate them directly in whole engine performance models. The modeling is validated against published experimental data and computational results. An example of implementation in an engine model is also presented."
584,Sector-wide or disease-specific? Implications of trends in development assistance for health for the SDG era,A. Buffardi,Health Policy and Planning,"The record of the Millennium Development Goals broadly reflects the trade-offs of disease-specific financing: substantial progress in particular areas, facilitated by time-bound targets that are easy to measure and communicate, which shifted attention and resources away from other areas, masked inequalities and exacerbated fragmentation. In many ways, the Sustainable Development Goals reflect a profound shift towards a more holistic, system-wide approach. To inform responses to this shift, this article builds upon existing work on aggregate trends in donor financing, bringing together what have largely been disparate analyses of sector-wide and disease-specific financing approaches. Looking across the last 26 years, the article examines how international donors have allocated development assistance for health (DAH) between these two approaches and how attempts to bridge them have fared in practice. Since 1990, DAH has overwhelmingly favoured disease-specific earmarks over health sector support, with the latter peaking in 1998. Attempts to integrate system strengthening elements into disease-specific funding mechanisms have varied by disease, and more integrated funding platforms have failed to gain traction. Health sector support largely remains an unfulfilled promise: proportionately low amounts (albeit absolute increases) which have been inconsistently allocated, and the overall approach inconsistently applied in practice. Thus, the expansive orientation of the Sustainable Development Goals runs counter to trends over the last several decades. Financing proposals and efforts to adapt global health institutions must acknowledge and account for the persistent challenges in the financing and implementation of integrated, cross-sector policies. National and subnational experimentation may offer alternatives within and beyond the health sector."

Demerath;S. Czerwinski,Journal of Hypertension,"Background: Some studies have shown a decline in blood pressure (BP) over the second half of the twentieth century. However, the increasing prevalence of obesity may have opposite effects on recent cohorts. Method: Using serial BP data from the Fels Longitudinal Study, we examined secular trends in mean BP, the rate of change in BP with age (slopes), and the influence of obesity (i.e., BMI) and height on these trends during young-to-middle adulthood. The study sample consisted of 970 adults, aged 18–40 years, who were born between 1920 and 1979. Participants were grouped into birth decade cohorts and had up to 11 serial measurements of SBP, DBP, and BMI. Sex-stratified mixed longitudinal analyses were used to identify cohort effects on mean BP at ages 19, 29, and 39 years, and on the rate of change in BP with age. Results: For both sexes, mean SBP did not vary significantly by birth cohort, before and after adjusting for height and BMI. Mean DBP exhibited a U-shaped secular trend even after adjusting for BMI and height that was influenced by age-by-cohort effects. By age 39 years, those born most recently had the highest mean DBP. Conclusion: There were cohort effects on the rate of change in DBP with age, but not on rate of SBP change. The most recent cohorts had higher rates of DBP change with age compared to the earlier cohorts. The secular trend was partially influenced by the trends in BMI."
586,Sediment Concentrations of Trace Metals in the Berre Lagoon (France): An Assessment of Contamination,A. Accornero;R. Gnerre;L. Manfra,Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,"This paper reports the concentrations of eight trace metals (Cr, Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, As, Cd, and Hg) in the surficial sediments of the Berre lagoon. This is a typical Mediterranean lagoon, seriously affected by human activities since the 1930s, when it became one of the most important industrial sites in France. The overall range of concentrations is 38–428 mg kg−1 for chromium, 50–151 mg kg−1 for zinc, 11–48 mg kg−1 for copper, 18–82 mg kg−1 for lead, 18–56 mg kg−1 for nickel, 4–10 mg kg−1 for arsenic, 0.2–1.6 mg kg−1 for cadmium, and 0.15–0.40 mg kg−1 for mercury. The spatial distribution of concentrations largely mirrors the localization of major impact sources, with the most affected area restricted to a radius of a few kilometers from point sources, due to the environmental conditions of the outfall zone (fine sediments, low hydrodynamic regime, confinement), which favor the in situ accumulation of pollutants. The extent of contamination from trace metals in the lagoon sediments is evaluated through a three-pronged approach: (i) by comparison with other areas (see Table 3 for an up-to-date review of trace metal concentrations in lagoon systems and coastal regions of the world ocean); (ii) by evaluating the metal enrichment in the sediments through the calculation of concentration factors (CF) for each trace metal and by combining the CFs to estimate a Metal Pollution Index (MPI) taking into account the differences in toxicity of trace metals; and (iii) by defining a potential level of biological risk by the use of quality criteria such as the Threshold Effect Level (TEL) and Effects Range–Low (ER-L) benchmarks. On the basis of the calculated CFs, sediments appear as particularly enriched with Pb and Cd throughout the lagoon and with Cr and Zn at some sites. Although no site can be classified as “unpolluted” when looking at the calculated MPIs, two regions—the Vane pond and the southwestern area—have been identified as critical points of contamination. Trace metal inputs to the lagoon need to be kept under strict control in the future, with particular regard to Ni, Cr, Pb, and Cu that, on the basis of TEL and ER-L benchmarks, already appear associated with a potential biological risk."

Caracciolo;E. Sánchez;I. Trinidad,Journal of South American Earth Sciences,"The Mesozoic rocks of southern Peru comprise a Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous sedimentary sequence deposited during a time interval of approximately 34 Myr. In Tacna, these rocks are detrital and constitute the Yura Group (Callovian to Tithonian) and the Hualhuani Formation (Berriasian). Basing on robust interpretation of facies and petrographic analysis, we reconstruct the depositional settings of such units and provide a refined stratigraphic framework. Accordingly, nine types of sedimentary facies and six architectural elements are defined. They preserve the record of a progradational fluvial system, in which two styless regulated the dispersion of sediments: (i) a high-to moderate-sinuosity meandering setting (Yura Group), and a later (ii) incipient braided setting (Hualhuani Formation).The Yura Group (Callovian-Tithonian) represents the onset of floodplain deposits and lateral accretion of point-bar deposits sited on a semi-flat topography.

588,"Sedimentary facies and stratigraphic architecture in coarse-grained deltas: Anatomy of the Cenozoic Camaná Formation, southern Peru (16°25′S to 17°15′S)",A. Alván;H. Eynatten,Journal of South American Earth Sciences,"In the external forearc of southern Peru (Arequipa region), the sedimentary facies and the stratigraphic architecture of the Cenozoic Camaná Formation are presented in the context of tectono-eustatic controls. The Camaná Formation is defined as ∼500 m thick coarse-grained deltaic complex that accumulated in a fault-bounded elongated depression extending from the Coastal Cordillera in the east to the offshore Mollendo Basin in the west and likely up to the Peruvian Trench. Based on the analysis of facies associations, we propose a refined stratigraphic scheme of the Camaná Basin fill. The Camaná Formation was formerly divided into the Camaná “A” and Camaná “B” units (CamA and CamB, respectively). We reinterpret the stratigraphic position and the timing of the CamA to CamB boundary, and define three sub-units for CamA, i.e. sub-units A1, A2, and A3. Each depositional unit shows individual stacking patterns, which are linked with particular shoreline trajectories through time.Strata of A1 form the basal succession of the Camaná Formation and consist of distributary channels and mouth bars, unconformably overlain by beds of A2. A2 consists of delta front deposits arranged in voluminous clinothems that reflect a progradational downstepping complex. A3 consists of delta front sandstones to prodelta siltstones arranged in retrogradational onlapping geometry. A pebbly intercalation in proximal onlapping A3 deposits is interpreted to reflect pulses of uplift in the hinterland. The overlying CamB unit is characterized by a thick alternation of fluvio-deltaic conglomerates and sand bars. The ages of the individual units of the Camaná Formation are not yet well defined. Based on the available information and stratigraphic correlations we tentatively assign A1 to the Late Oligocene, A2 to the Early Miocene, A3 to the late Early Miocene to early Middle Miocene, and CamB to the Late Miocene to? early Pliocene.The sub-units A1 and A2 represent a regressive systems tract, where the shoreline was forced to migrate seaward. This scenario differs from the Early Miocene eustatic sea-level rise suggesting that significant tectonic uplift along the Coastal Cordillera controlled the high sediment influx during A2 deposition. The sub-unit A3 represents a transgressive systems tract, triggering landward migration of the shoreline. This scenario is well in line with the global sea-level chart suggesting that A3 has been deposited during a phase of eustatic sea-level rise with minor tectonic activity. The fluvial deposits of CamB reflect an increased sediment flux due to uplift of the hinterland. The observed stratigraphic patterns support predominant tectonic control on sedimentation in the Camaná Basin and the established stratigraphic framework provides an essential baseline for future correlations of the Cenozoic sedimentation in the forearc area of the Central Andes.Camaná Formation consists of Cenozoic coarse-grained deltas.Its stratigraphic position and timing is refined.Depositional settings were interpreted since analysis of facies associations.Stacking patterns reflect relative sea-level fluctuations that differ from the eustatic cycle.The source rocks were the Coastal and Western cordilleras and/or recycling of the Moquegua Group.In the external forearc of southern Peru (Arequipa region), the sedimentary facies and the stratigraphic architecture of the Cenozoic Camaná Formation are presented in the context of tectono-eustatic controls. The Camaná Formation is defined as ∼500 m thick coarse-grained deltaic complex that accumulated in a fault-bounded elongated depression extending from the Coastal Cordillera in the east to the offshore Mollendo Basin in the west and likely up to the Peruvian Trench. Based on the analysis of facies associations, we propose a refined stratigraphic scheme of the Camaná Basin fill. The Camaná Formation was formerly divided into the Camaná “A” and Camaná “B” units (CamA and CamB, respectively). We reinterpret the stratigraphic position and the timing of the CamA to CamB boundary, and define three sub-units for CamA, i.e. sub-units A1, A2, and A3.

589,Seismic tests for solar models withtachocline mixing,A. Brun;H. Antia;S. Chitre;J. Zahn,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"We have computed accurate 1-D solar models including both a macroscopic mixing process in the solar tachocline as well as up-to-date microscopic physical ingredients. Using sound speed and density profiles inferred through primary inversion of the solar oscillation frequencies coupled with the equation of thermal equilibrium, we have extracted the temperature and hydrogen abundance profiles. These inferred quantities place strong constraints on our theoretical models in terms of the extent and strength of our macroscopic mixing, on the photospheric heavy elements abundance, on the nuclear reaction rates such as S11 and S34 and on the efficiency of the microscopic diffusion. We find a good overall agreement between the seismic Sun and our models if we introduce a macroscopic mixing in the tachocline and allow for variation within their uncertainties of the main physical ingredients. From our study we deduce that the solar hydrogen abundance at the solar age is and that based on the 9Be photospheric depletion, the maximum extent of mixing in the tachocline is 5% of the solar radius. The nuclear reaction rate for the fundamental pp reaction is found to be 10-25 MeV barns, i.e., 1.5% higher than the present theoretical determination. The predicted solar neutrino fluxes are discussed in the light of the new SNO/SuperKamiokande results."
590,Selecting the best performing fire weather indices for Austrian ecoregions,A. Arpaci;C. Eastaugh;H. Vacik,Theoretical and Applied Climatology,"The interpretation and communication of fire danger warning levels based on fire weather index values are critical for fire management activities. A number of different indices have been developed for various environmental conditions, and many of them are currently applied in operational warning systems. To select an appropriate combination of such indices to work in different ecoregions in mountainous, hilly and flat terrain is challenging. This study analyses the performance of a total of 22 fire weather indices and two raw meteorological variables to predict wildfire occurrence for different ecological regions of Austria with respect to the different characteristics in climate and fire regimes. A median-based linear model was built based on percentile results on fire days and non-fire days to get quantifiable measures of index performance using slope and intercept of an index on fire days. We highlight the finding that one single index is not optimal for all Austrian regions in both summer and winter fire seasons. The summer season (May–November) shows that the Canadian build-up index, the Keetch Byram Drought Index and the mean daily temperature have the best performance; in the winter season (December–April), the M68dwd is the best performing index. It is shown that the index performance on fire days where larger fires appeared is better and that the uncertainties related to the location of the meteorological station can influence the overall results. A proposal for the selection of the best performing fire weather indices for each Austrian ecoregion is made."
591,Selection of Natural Peptide Ligands for Copper-Catalyzed Azide–Alkyne Cycloaddition Catalysis,A. Aioub;L. Dahora;K. Gamble;M. Finn,Bioconjugate Chemistry,"The copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction is a powerful tool for making connections in both organic reactions and biological systems. However, the use of this ligation process in living cells is limited by the toxicity associated with unbound copper ions. As an initial attempt to create peptide-based accelerating ligands capable of cellular expression, we performed synthesis and selection for such species on solid-phase synthesis beads bearing both candidate ligand and alkyne substrate. A simple histidine-containing motif (HXXH) was identified, and found after solution-phase optimization to produce single-turnover systems showing moderate rate acceleration over the ligand-free reaction. CuAAC reaction rates and yields for different alkynes were found to respond to the peptide ligands, demonstrating a substrate scope beyond what was used for the selection steps, but also illustrating the potential difficulty in evolving a general CuAAC catalyst."

Zanella,Journal of Catalysis,"Bimetallic Au-Ni supported on TiO2 were prepared using co-deposition-precipitation with urea and tested on the selective hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene. The catalyst containing the lower amount of Ni (atomic Au:Ni 1:0.08) showed a satisfying compromise between activity provided by Ni and selectivity to butenes provided by Au for this selective hydrogenation reaction. Even though Au and Ni exhibit limited miscibility in the bulk, characterizations by TPR and UV–vis spectroscopy showed evidence of interaction between Au and Ni in nanoparticles. STEM-XEDS study confirmed the formation of bimetallic nanoparticles."
593,Selective hydrogenolysis of glycerol over copper catalysts both in liquid and vapour phase: Correlation between the copper surface area and the catalyst's activity,A. Bienholz;H. Hofmann;P. Claus,Applied Catalysis A: General,"The hydrogenolysis of glycerol was performed both in liquid and in vapour phase by the use of different copper catalysts. The reactions in liquid phase were carried out using copper catalysts which differ in their copper content (36–89 wt.%) and, thus, in their composition while for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol in the vapour phase a set of different silica supported copper catalysts (Cu/SiO2, low copper loading) was prepared either by incipient wetness (IW) or by ion exchange technique (IE).Concerning the reactions in the vapour phase complete conversion of glycerol and a selectivity to 1,2-propanediol of 87% was achieved over a Cu/SiO2_IE catalyst under optimised reaction conditions (255 °C, 15 bar, 300 ml/min H2). In liquid phase hydrogenation, 1,2-propanediol was nearly the sole product (selectivity = 98%), and conversions up to 52% were obtained according to a space–time–yield of 5.9 g1,2-propanediol/(gCu h).N2O chemisorption was carried out in order to determine the specific copper surface area of the catalysts.

In the pH range 5.0 to 5.5, approximately 20% of the cytosine bases in mixed Escherichia coli transfer RNA are reactive towards methoxyamine.The cytosine bases in the su+III tyrosine suppressor tRNA which are reactive towards methoxyamine have been characterized as C-16, 19, 35, 51, 83 and 84. Surprisingly, residue C-33, a base at the 5′ terminal of the anticodon loop, is relatively resistant to modification.

595,Selectively Impaired Associative Learning in Older People with Cognitive Decline,A. Collie;C. Myers;G. Schnirman;S. Wood;P. Maruff,Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,"Older people with declining cognitive function typically display deficits in declarative memory processes, often most evident on tests of associative learning (AL). The hippocampal formation (HF) is thought to be critically involved in the encoding and retrieval of such associations, consistent with neuroimaging findings that the HF is damaged in early stages of neurodegenerative disease and in older people with AL impairments. In the clinic, older people with cognitive decline commonly report difficulties associating names with faces. However, we have observed that such people are particularly impaired on tests requiring the association of novel stimuli. In Experiment 1, a series of AL tasks were administered to older people with cognitive decline to determine whether they were impaired at simply making associations, or at making associations between novel stimuli. In Experiment 2, we measured HF function in these subjects by administering an AL task designed to differentiate between HF-damaged and HF-intact individuals. Our experimental protocols were guided by a computational model of HF function in AL described by Gluck and Myers (1997). Older people with cognitive decline displayed impaired performance on tasks designed to be highly dependent upon intact HF function, including a task in which novel patterns and spatial locations were to be associated. These results suggest that the AL impairments observed in older people with cognitive decline may be due to HF dysfunction."
596,Seleno l-Methionine Acts on Cyclophosphamide-Induced Kidney Toxicity,A. Ayhanci;S. Günes;V. Sahinturk;S. Appak;R. Uyar;M. Cengiz;Y. Altuner;S. Yaman,Biological Trace Element Research,"The anticancer drug cyclophosphamide (CP) has nephrotoxic effects besides its urotoxicity, which both in turn limit its clinical utility. The nephrotoxicity of CP is less common compared to its urotoxicity, and not much importance has been given for the study of mechanism of CP-induced nephrotoxicity so far. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during inflammation is one of the reasons of the kidney injury. Selenoproteins play crucial roles in regulating ROS and redox status in nearly all tissues; therefore, in this study, the nephrotoxicity of CP and the possible protective effects of seleno l-methionine (SLM) on rat kidneys were investigated. Forty-two Sprague–Dawley rats were equally divided into six groups of seven rats each. The control group received saline, and other rats were injected with CP (100 mg/kg), SLM (0.5 or 1 mg/kg), or CP + SLM intraperitoneally. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels in kidney homogenates of rats were measured, and kidney tissues were examined under the microscope. CP-treated rats showed a depletion of renal GSH levels (28% of control), while CP + SLM-injected rats had GSH values close to the control group. MDA levels increased 36% of control following CP administration, which were significantly decreased after SLM treatment. Furthermore, these biochemical results were supported by microscopical observations. In conclusion, the present study not only points to the therapeutic potential of SLM in CP-induced kidney toxicity but also indicates a significant role for ROS and their relation to kidney dysfunction."
597,Self-Assembly and Phase Behavior of New (α-Hydroxyalkyl)phosphorus Amphiphiles,A. Brun;D. Albouy;E. Perez;I. Rico-Lattes;G. Etemad-Moghadam,Langmuir,"A new series of (α-hydroxyalkyl)phosphinic acids 1 was prepared in good yields from long-chain aldehydes (C8−C18) and 50% aqueous hypophosphorous acid under sonication. Oxidation of these phosphinic acids by dimethyl sulfoxide in the presence of catalytic amounts of iodine afforded the corresponding (α-hydroxyalkyl)phosphonic acids 2. Critical micelle concentrations (cmc) of the amphiphilic monocaternary (α-hydroxyalkyl)phosphorus acid ammonium salts 1 and 2, determined by tensiometry and 31P NMR, showed a good correlation between the two methods and indicated their high surfactant properties. The phosphonate salts 2 with two dissociable groups had much higher cmc values than those of the corresponding phosphinate analogues 1. The ammonium salts of these phosphorus acids were able to form ordered lyotropic mesophases in concentrated water solutions, visualized by optical polarization microscopy. The nature of the observed mesophases (hexagonal or lamellar) depended on the concentration, the temperature, the nature of the polar head, and the length of the alkyl chain, the hexagonal phase being promoted for shorter chains (C8 and C10). The ability of these acids 1−2 to form stable and compact Langmuir monolayers at the air/water interface was studied. Their conformations at the air/water interface were estimated by a molecular modeling study."
598,Self-Assembly of Protein Monolayers Engineered for Improved Monoclonal Immunoglobulin G Binding,A. Brun;D. Shah;D. Athey;S. Holt;J. Lakey,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,"Bacterial outer membrane proteins, along with a filling lipid molecule can be modified to form stable self-assembled monolayers on gold. The transmembrane domain of Escherichia coli outer membrane protein A has been engineered to create a scaffold protein to which functional motifs can be fused. In earlier work we described the assembly and structure of an antibody-binding array where the Z domain of Staphylococcus aureus protein A was fused to the scaffold protein. Whilst the binding of rabbit polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the array is very strong, mouse monoclonal IgG dissociates from the array easily. This is a problem since many immunodiagnostic tests rely upon the use of mouse monoclonal antibodies. Here we describe a strategy to develop an antibody-binding array that will bind mouse monoclonal IgG with lowered dissociation from the array. A novel protein consisting of the scaffold protein fused to two pairs of Z domains separated by a long flexible linker was manufactured. Using surface plasmon resonance the self-assembly of the new protein on gold and the improved binding of mouse monoclonal IgG were demonstrated."
599,Self-Capacitance of Single-Layer Inductors With Separation Between Conductor Turns,A. Ayachit;M. Kazimierczuk,IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility,"This letter presents the technique for estimating the self-capacitance of single-layer air-core solenoid inductors with separation between the insulated turns. In single-layer air-core inductors, the self-capacitance is due to the conductor turn-to-turn capacitances. The analytical framework to determine the turn-to-turn capacitances of single-layer air-core inductors with uniformly and nonuniformly separated conductor turns is established. The influence of the wire insulation coating is taken into consideration. A representative design example of a single-layer air-core inductor is presented and its self-capacitance and self-resonant frequency are predicted. The presented analytical approach was tested by experimental measurements on the designed inductor. The derived analytical expressions are useful for designing air-core inductors for high frequency (HF) and very HF applications such as electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic compatibility filters and radio and TV transmitters."

Lönnecke;E. Hey-Hawkins,Dalton Transactions,"Novel macroheterocyclic tetraphosphines, namely, 1,1′,5,5′-bis(arylene)-bis(1,5-diaza-3,7-diphosphacyclooctanes) 2–6, were obtained without the use of high-dilution techniques or any matrix by the reaction of bis(hydroxymethyl)organylphosphines with primary aromatic diamines containing two p-phenylene fragments linked by various one-atom bridges in a molecular self-assembly process. The structures of 4, 5 and 6 were investigated by X-ray crystal structure analyses. The macrocyclic cavities can be described as a truncated rhombohedral prism with side faces formed by phenylene rings and 1,5-diaza-3,7-diphosphacyclooctanes in the truncated acute angles. In the crystals of these macrocycles, solvating DMF molecules are present, and a methyl group from each of two DMF molecules penetrates the macrocyclic cavities of 4 and 5 from either side, whereas only one disordered molecule of DMF penetrates the cavity of macrocycle 6. Different types of crystal packing are observed for the P-benzyl-substituted compounds 4 and 5 and for the P-mesityl-substituted compound 6: for 4 and 5 the formation of alternating layers containing the macrocycles and the DMF molecules is observed, in which the cavities of the macrocyclic molecules form channels and the DMF molecules are located in the centers of the channels; in the crystal of 6, six molecules are arranged around the axis in the fashion of a six-bladed propeller."

604,Self‐modelling as a relapse intervention following speech‐restructuring treatment for stuttering,A. Cream;S. O'Brian;M. Onslow;A. Packman;R. Menzies,International Journal of Language and Communication Disorders,"Background: Speech restructuring is an efficacious method for the alleviation of stuttered speech. However, post‐treatment relapse is common.Aims: To investigate whether the use of video self‐modelling using restructured stutter‐free speech reduces stuttering in adults who had learnt a speech‐restructuring technique and subsequently relapsed.Methods & Procedures: Participants were twelve adults who had previously had speech‐restructuring treatment for stuttering and relapsed. They were video recorded for 1 hour within the clinic, practising their speech‐restructuring technique. The videos were then edited to remove all observable stuttering. Participants then viewed the resulting video of themselves using restructured stutter‐free speech each day for 1 month and were instructed to speak as they did on the video. Beyond‐clinic speech samples and self‐report severity data were collected before and after the intervention.Outcomes & Results: Very large effect sizes were found. The mean per cent syllables stuttered was 7.7 pre‐intervention and 2.3 post‐intervention. For all but one participant there was a reduction in stuttering from pre‐intervention to post‐intervention. These results were verified with self‐report data. Speech naturalness was not compromised by the video self‐modelling procedure.Conclusion & Implications: Video self‐modelling as a relapse management tool does not involve excessive time expenditure by the clinician or the client. The study indicates video self‐modelling is potentially useful for managing relapse after speech‐restructuring treatment for stuttering, and in some cases may be a stand‐alone procedure to manage relapse. Phase II and III trials are warranted to determine the size and duration of the effect. It is suggested video self‐modelling could also be included in a relapse management plan."
605,Sensitivity enhancement of a surface plasmon resonance sensor using porous metamaterial layers,A. Cherifi;B. Bouhafs,Materials Research Express,"In this work, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) device with two porous left handed metamaterial (LHM) layers separated by an insulator gap, is investigated. The effect of the insulator gap thickness and its refractive index (RI) on the angular response of the device is analyzed. The results show that the sensitivity of the SPR sensor is enhanced compared to the standard SPR sensors. Here, the multilayer structure is probed with 738 nm-wavelength, and electromagnetic properties of active porous LHM layers are described from the effective medium theory (EMT). Furthermore, in the increase of the porosity from 0 to 0.6, the designed nanocavity exhibits a fundamental SPR mode long-range (LR) type and it can be of interest in high-performance SPR sensing."

Mor,Helminthologia,"This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of Fasciola hepatica infection in cattle and sheep in the province of Kars, Turkey. Serum samples from 500 cattle and 540 sheep, collected from 15 randomly selected localities (villages) in the region, were tested for the presence of anti-F. hepatica antibodies using an in-house ELISA test with 98 % sensitivity and 96 % specificity. The seroprevalence of F. hepatica in the district was determined to be 66.6 % (333/500) in cattle and 93 % (502/540) in sheep. There was also a statistically significant difference in the rates of seropositivity between villages (each of which could be considered to be a large herd or flock), ranging from 0 % to 100 % in cattle and from 68 % to 100 % in sheep, P &lt; 0.01). These findings show that F. hepatica infection is very common in the region; that, in contrast to results from abattoir which indicate a level of only 10 % prevalence, the exposure of farm animals to the infection in the region is in fact very high; and that the risk of acquiring the infection varies between the localities and the host species tested within the region."

609,Severe Salt-Losing 3β-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Deficiency: Treatment and Outcomes of HSD3B2 c.35G>A Homozygotes,A. Benkert;M. Young;D. Robinson;C. Hendrickson;P. Lee,Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,"3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B2) deficiency accounts for less than 5% of congenital adrenal hyperplasia worldwide, but is relatively common among the Old Order Amish of North America due to a HSD3B2 c.35G&gt;A founder mutation.We review clinical presentation, disease course, treatment, and outcomes of a genetically homogenous population of HSD3B2-deficient patients.This was a retrospective case series: anthropometric, biochemical, and clinical data from 16 (six male) affected subjects (age, 7.2 ± 6.4 y) were compared to reference data from 12 age-matched unaffected siblings.The setting was the Clinic for Special Children, a nonprofit rural community health center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.The main outcome measures were growth, skeletal maturation, sexual development, blood pressure, glucocorticoid dose, pituitary-adrenal homeostasis, and long-term morbidity.Exogenous glucocorticoid requirement was dichotomous: a standard-dose group (n = 9) required 15.4 ± 4.9 mg/m2/d hydrocortisone equivalent, whereas a high-dose group required much larger and more variable doses (hydrocortisone equivalent, 37.8 ± 15.4 mg/m2/d) (P &lt; .0001). Despite glucocorticoid doses 2-fold higher than the standard-dose group, high-dose patients: 1) had ACTH, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone levels that were 10-fold, 20-fold, and 20-fold higher, respectively; 2) were exclusively affected by signs of sex steroid excess; and 3) tended to have more iatrogenic complications.Patients with HSD3B2 deficiency and 21-hydroxylase deficiency suffer similar morbid complications from under- and overtreatment, but HSD3B2 deficiency is associated with a distinctive pattern of sex steroid dysmetabolism. Disease- and treatment-related morbidities are almost exclusively observed among subjects who have a high exogenous glucocorticoid requirement."
610,Sex-specific impact of socio-economic factors on suicide risk: a population-based case–control study in Denmark,A. Andrés;S. Collings;P. Qin,European Journal of Public Health,"Background: Although many authors have investigated the impact of sex on the association between socio-economic status (SES) and suicide, a definite consensus has not yet emerged. Using Danish population registration data including 15 648 suicide deaths of individuals aged 18–65 year during 1981–97 and matched population controls, we investigate the associations of multiple SES factors with suicide risk and explore the sex-specific aspects of these associations. Methods: We use conditional logistic regression models to estimate the statistical relationship between SES, sex and suicide. Results: SES, proxied by low income, unskilled blue-collar work, non-specific wage work and unemployment, increases suicide risk more prominently for men than for women. Marital status has a comparable influence on suicide risk in both sexes; parenthood is protective against suicide, and the effect is larger for women. Living in a large city raises suicide risk for women but reduces it for men; residents with a foreign citizenship in Denmark have a lower risk of suicide compared with Danish citizens, but this protection is confined to male immigrants. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that suicide risk is associated with a range of SES proxies but the strength and/or direction of the association can differ by sex. Risk assessement and, therefore, prevention approaches should take this into consideration."
611,Shale gas transmission and housing prices,A. Boslett,Resource and Energy Economics,"In this study, we exploit residential property sales data in New York to value the external environmental costs of the proposed Constitution Pipeline, a high-capacity transmission pipeline designed to transport hydraulically-fractured natural gas in Pennsylvania to large northeastern markets. Results from difference-in-differences models suggest post-announcement price declines of 9% (˜$12,000) for those properties located within three kilometers of the pipeline. These results are strongly robust to different specifications and subsets of the data, as well as falsification testing. Additionally, we find some evidence of attenuation in our treatment effect over time, which is indicative of either declining salience or expectations of the pipeline over time. Our results suggest that homebuyer expectations of the environmental externalities of natural gas pipeline construction and operations are large and negative."
612,Shişr 043 (IIIAB medium octahedrite): The first iron meteorite from the Oman desert,A. Al‐Kathiri;B. Hofmann;E. Gnos;O. Eugster;K. Welten;U. Krähenbühl,Meteoritics & Planetary Science,"— The iron meteorite Shişr 043 is a single mass of 8267 g found in the south Oman desert 42 km NE of the Shişr village. It is the first iron identified among the >1400 individual meteorites reported from Oman. The meteorite is a slightly elongated mass showing only minor rusting, a partially smooth and partially rough surface with octahedral cleavage, and a partially preserved metallic fusion crust typically 0.75 mm thick. The undeformed Widmanstätten pattern with a mean kamacite bandwidth of 1.0 ± 0.1 mm (n = 97) indicates structural classification as a medium octahedrite. From the bulk composition, Ni = 8.06 wt%, Ga = 18.8 ppm, Ge = 37.25 ppm, and Ir = 3.92 ppm, the meteorite is classified as IIIAB, the most common group of iron meteorites. The cosmic‐ray exposure (CRE) age based on 3He, 21Ne, 38Ar concentrations and 10Be‐21Ne, 26Al‐21Ne, and 36Cl‐36Ar ratios is 290 ± 20 Ma. This age falls within the range observed for type IIIAB iron meteorites, but does not coincide with the main cluster. The cosmogenic noble gas and radionuclide data indicate that Shişr 043 had a relatively small preatmospheric mass. The low degree of weathering is consistent with a young terrestrial age of <10,000 years based on the saturated 41Ca concentration. Shişr 043 is not paired with any of the other eight known iron meteorites from the Arabian Peninsula."
613,Shopping or Specialization? Venue Targeting among Nonprofits Engaged in Advocacy,A. Buffardi;R. Pekkanen;S. Smith,Policy Studies Journal,"Studies of venue shopping have typically analyzed the case of an individual advocacy group or issue campaign rather than comparing venue strategies across multiple groups. Moreover, this literature focuses on interest groups and advocacy coalitions whose principal mandate is to influence public policy. Using original data, we test theories of venue selection among nonprofit organizations that report engaging in policy processes but the majority of which do not self‐identify as an advocacy group. Our analyses explore the “where” of nonprofit advocacy across three different venue types: branch (executive, legislative), domain (bureaucracy, elected officials), and level of government (local, state, federal). Like interest groups, we find that nonprofits shop among both executive and legislative branches and among elected and bureaucratic domains; however, they tend to specialize in one level of government. Geographic scope and revenue source predicted venue targeting, but most other organizational characteristics including age, capacity, and structure did not."
614,Short-Term Impact of a Multimedia Communication Campaign on Children's Physical Activity Beliefs and Behavior,A. Bélanger-Gravel;N. Cutumisu;F. Lagarde;M. Laferté;L. Gauvin,Journal of Health Communication,"To examine the short-term impact of the WIXX multimedia communication campaign on children’s physical activity (PA) beliefs and behaviors, 3 repeated cross-sectional telephone surveys were conducted before, 9 months after, and 21 months after the launch of the campaign. A random-digit dialing procedure was used to recruit children ages 9 to 13 years. Children’s PA beliefs, behaviors, and recall of the WIXX ads were self-reported. Logistic regression models showed that girls exposed to the WIXX ads were more likely to believe that PA would help to make new friends (odds ratio [OR] = 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.0, 1.9]) and that they can be active even if too busy (OR = 1.4, 95% CI [1.0, 1.8]) compared to girls not exposed. Boys exposed were more likely to believe that PA would help to spend time with friends (OR = 1.4, 95% CI [1.1, 1.9]). Boys (OR = 1.5, 95% CI [1.1, 2.0.]) and girls (OR = 1.4, 95% CI [1.1, 1.8]) exposed were more likely to report having tried new PAs. No significant impact of the campaign was observed on overall PA after we controlled for confounders. Recall of the WIXX ads was associated with a significant, albeit modest, impact on some PA beliefs and intermediate PA behaviors."
615,Shrub shading moderates the effects of weather on arthropod activity in arctic tundra,A. Asmus;H. Chmura;T. Høye;J. Krause;S. Sweet;J. Perez;N. Boelman;J. Wingfield;L. Gough,Ecological Entomology,"1. Rapid warming has facilitated an increase in deciduous shrub cover in arctic tundra. Because shrubs create a cooler microclimate during the growing season, shrub cover could modulate the effects of global warming on the phenology and activity of ectotherms, including arthropods. This possibility was explored here using two dominant arthropod groups (flies and wolf spiders) in Alaskan tundra. 2. We monitored arthropods with pitfall traps over five summers at four sites that differed in shrub abundance, and used generalised additive mixed models (GAMMs) to separate the two underlying components of pitfall trap catch: the seasonal trend in arthropod density and the effects of short‐term weather variation (air temperature, wind speed, rainfall, solar radiation) on arthropod activity. 3. We found that shrub cover significantly altered the seasonal trend in the abundance of flies by reducing early‐season pitfall catch, in line with observed later snowmelt in shrub‐dominated plots at these sites. 4. Additionally, shrub cover modulated the effects of many weather variables on arthropod activity: shrub cover shifted wolf spiders' temperature–activity relationship, dampened the positive effect of solar radiation on the activity of arthropods in total, and ameliorated the negative effect of wind on the activity of flies. 5. Thus, these results indicate that shrub encroachment will probably be accompanied by altered arthropod responses to warming and other key weather variables. Because the rate of key ecological processes – herbivory, decomposition, predation – are controlled by activity at the organismal level, these effects on arthropods will have long‐term ecosystem‐level consequences."
616,Silver Nanocrystals: Self-Organization and Collective Properties,A. Courty,Journal of Physical Chemistry C,"In this paper, the main parameters, which dictate the supracrystalline structure of silver nanocrystals self-assembled at the micrometer scale, are evidenced. They are the alkyl-chain length, the deposition temperature, the concentration of the colloidal solution and the nature of the substrate. By varying the deposition temperature (from 15° to 50 °C), from the same batch of nanocrystals (same size, same coating agent), dense (fcc and hcp) and loose (bcc) supracrystals or disordered arrangements (rcp) are produced. By tuning the nature of the substrate (HOPG or amorphous carbon) and its temperature, the final size of the supracrystals is controlled. Collective properties due to either nanocrystals ordering in 2D superlattices or in supracrystals (3D) are pointed out. These properties are either due to dipolar interactions with the appearance of coupled plasmon modes or to the attraction between nanocrystals, self-assembled via interdigitation of the alkylchains used as coating agents, which leads to coherent vibrations of nanocrystals in a supracrystal."
617,Silver complexes stabilized by large silanethiolate ligands – crystal structures and luminescence properties,A. Ciborska;Z. Hnatejko;K. Kazimierczuk;A. Mielcarek;A. Wiśniewska;A. Dołęga,Dalton Transactions,Bulky silanethiolate and disiladithiolate ligands were applied to synthesize one mononuclear and three trinuclear silver complexes including two cyclic “microclusters” and a linear tri-nuclear silanethiolate complex. All obtained compounds are characterized by X-ray diffraction and FT-IR. NMR and emission spectroscopies were used where possible. The first trinuclear anionic silver thiolate is structurally characterized. The influence of the different charge of cyclic silver complexes as well as the overall ligand environment on the structural properties is demonstrated. The impact of the different synthetic routes on the final structures of the obtained clusters – cyclic or linear – is discussed.
618,Simulation of the capabilities of an orbiter for monitoring the entry of interplanetary matter into the terrestrial atmosphere,A. Bouquet;D. Baratoux;J. Vaubaillon;M. Gritsevich;S. Bouley,Planetary and Space Science,"In comparison with existing ground-based camera networks for meteors monitoring, a space-based optical system would escape dependency on weather and atmospheric conditions and would offer a wide spatial coverage and an unrestricted and extinction-free spectral domain. The potential rates of meteor detections by such systems are evaluated in this paper as a function of observations parameters (optical system capabilities, orbital parameters) and considering a reasonable range of meteoroids properties (e.g., mass, velocity, composition) determining their luminosity. A numerical tool called SWARMS (Simulator for Wide Area Recording of Meteors from Space) has been developed. SWARMS is also intended to be used in an operational phase to facilitate the comparison of observations with up-do-date constraints on the flux and characteristics of the interplanetary matter entering our planet׳s atmosphere. The laws governing the conversion of a fraction of the meteor kinetic energy into radiation during atmospheric entry have been revisited and evaluated based on an analysis of previously published meteor trajectories. Rates of detection were simulated for two different systems: the SPOSH (Smart Panoramic Optical Sensor Head) camera optimized for the observation of transient luminous events, and the JEM-EUSO (Japanese Experiment Module-Extreme Universe Space Observatory) experiment on the ISS (International Space Station). We conclude that up to 6 events per hour in the case of SPOSH, and up to 0.67 events in the case of JEM-EUSO may be detected. The optimal orbit for achieving such rates of detections depends on the mass index of the meteoroid populations. The determination of this parameter appears therefore critical before an optimal orbiting system might be designed for meteors monitoring.We programmed a simulator to assess how many meteors a dedicated satellite could detect.We linked the properties of a meteoroid with the luminosity of the produced meteor.We obtained a detection rate up to 6 events/h for a satellite using an existing camera.We can show the variation of detection rate depending on mission parameters.In comparison with existing ground-based camera networks for meteors monitoring, a space-based optical system would escape dependency on weather and atmospheric conditions and would offer a wide spatial coverage and an unrestricted and extinction-free spectral domain.

619,Simultaneous Le Fort I Osteotomy and Computer-Guided Implant Placement,A. Benech;C. Mazzanti;F. Arcuri;M. Giarda;M. Brucoli,Journal of Craniofacial Surgery,"Background: Since 1977, osseointegrated implants have played a strong role in oral rehabilitation. Despite the large success of this technique for the edentulous maxilla and mandible with sufficient bone height, patients with atrophic jaws continue to be the challenging cases for an adequate reconstruction of aesthetics and functionality. Orthognathic surgical procedures have been developed to reposition the jaws and have been traditionally used in the dentate patient to correct a skeletal malocclusion; these procedures can be used on the edentulous patient to correct the discrepancies between the jaws followed by the placement of implants to rehabilitate the oral cavity. Recently, surgeons can use a computer-assisted software package that enables them to insert implants after a digital analysis of the residual alveolar and basal bone that makes for greater implant osseointegration. We describe a one-step oral rehabilitation with Le Fort I osteotomy and computer-guided implant placement to correct a posttraumatic deformity. Clinical Report: The first step of the definitive treatment, the implant placement, was planned with the aid of a computer-assisted surgery software package (NobelGuide; Nobel Biocare AB, Goteborg, Sweden). Ten computer-planned implants (Nobel Biocare AB) were inserted (6 on the maxillary arch and 2 on each posterior area of the mandible). Simultaneously, the patient underwent a Le Fort I osteotomy to correct the maxillary deficiency without any bone grafts. Discussion: The use of Le Fort I osteotomy as a preprosthetic procedure for the atrophic edentulous maxilla has been well accepted. This is a technically demanding procedure, and there are some described complications such as unfavorable fractures of the maxilla, oroantral fistulas, bone exposure, and low implant survival rates. However, in selected cases, this reconstructive method has the advantages over the other commonly used preprosthetic techniques of simultaneously allowing the placement of osseointegrated implants while correcting an unfavorable intermaxillary relationship and improving facial aesthetics. Computer-assisted surgery offers to the surgeons the possibility to visualize anatomic structures, evaluate implant position and inclination, insert accurately implants, prefabricate prosthesis, and avoid the morbidity of bone grafting procedures. Conclusions: One-step oral rehabilitation by Le Fort I and computer-guided implant placement can be used in selected patients. Despite the difficulty of this procedure, this approach enabled the authors to solve simultaneously a double problem: the malocclusion and the partially atrophic and edentulous jaws. According to the literature, this is the first case of a simultaneous Le Fort I osteotomy and computer-guided implant placement. The patient introduced had a posttraumatic deformity, but we think that this procedure could be extended in the future to manage other situations."
620,Simultaneous application of two laser-induced fluorescence approaches for film thickness measurements in annular gas-liquid flows,A. Cherdantsev;J. An;A. Charogiannis;C. Markides,International Journal of Multiphase Flow,"This paper is devoted to the simultaneous application of two spatiotemporally resolved optical techniques capable of liquid film thickness measurements, namely Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) and Brightness-Based Laser-Induced Fluorescence (BBLIF), to co-current downward annular gas-liquid flows. A single laser sheet is used to excite the liquid film, which has been seeded with a fluorescent dye, along a longitudinal/vertical plane normal to the pipe wall. Two cameras, one for each technique, are placed at different angles to the plane of the laser sheet in order to recover, independently by the two techniques, the shape of the gas-liquid interface along this section. The effect of the angle between the laser sheet and the PLIF camera axis is also investigated. In film regions where the gas-liquid interface is smooth and flat, the conventional approach used for interpreting PLIF data is affected by total internal reflection of the fluorescent light at the free surface, or “mirror effect”, which leads to an overestimation of the film thickness that increases as the angle between the laser sheet and the camera axis is decreased. Nonetheless, local features such as light intensity maxima or minima are often located within the fluorescent signals that correctly identify the true interface, which in these conditions also coincides well with the BBLIF film-thickness measurement. When a correction for the mirror effect based on simple flat-film optical calculations is applied, this leads to PLIF results that correspond well to the true film thickness. Interestingly, it is further found that interfacial three-dimensionality, and in particular azimuthal/circumferential non-uniformity, can lead to underestimation of film thickness by PLIF that in some cases counteracts the overestimation due to the mirror effect. Smaller angles between the laser sheet and camera axis make PLIF less susceptible to this error. In regions where the film surface is rough, including on the surface of disturbance waves, the mirror effect is suppressed. The BBLIF measurement, on the other hand, is affected by loss of signal sensitivity or saturation in thick film regions, as well as distortions at complex or multiple interfaces in agitated flow regions with significant wave activity. Direct comparisons between PLIF and BBLIF measurement data confirm that local overestimations of the film thickness by the latter occur in film regions with higher interfacial curvature, especially at the front slopes of waves and around gas bubbles entrained in the liquid even in smooth films, while underestimations occur in regions with multiple interfaces and inside bubbles although it is often the case that features such as bubbles can be identified and corrected for in simple flows with smooth interfaces. Correction procedures are developed to compensate distortions caused by both methods that make these techniques more accurate for standalone employment. In highly complex, three-dimensional flows, the simultaneous application of both techniques is highly recommended to attain the most reliable information."
621,Simultaneous continuous measurement of non-commuting observables: quantum state correlations,A. Chantasri;J. Atalaya;S. Hacohen-Gourgy;L. Martin;I. Siddiqi;A. Jordan,ArXiv Physics,"We consider the temporal correlations of the quantum state of a qubit subject to simultaneous continuous measurement of two non-commuting qubit observables. Such qubit state correlators are defined for an ensemble of qubit trajectories, which has the same fixed initial state and can also be optionally constrained by a fixed final state. We develop a stochastic path integral description for the continuous quantum measurement and use it to calculate the considered correlators. Exact analytic results are possible in the case of ideal measurements of equal strength and are also shown to agree with solutions obtained using the Fokker-Planck equation. For a more general case with decoherence effects and inefficiency, we use a diagrammatic approach to find the correlators perturbatively in the quantum efficiency. We also calculate the state correlators for the quantum trajectories which are extracted from readout signals measured in a transmon qubit experiment, by means of the quantum Bayesian state update. We find an excellent agreement between the correlators based on the experimental data and those obtained from our analytical and numerical results."
622,Simultaneous enhancement of charge generation quantum yield and carrier transport in organic solar cells,A. Armin;P. Wolfer;P. Shaw;M. Hambsch;F. Maasoumi;M. Ullah;E. Gann;C. Mcneill;J. Li;Z. Shi;P. Burn;P. Meredith,Journal of Materials Chemistry C,"Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells and photodiodes require optimised active layer structures for both charge carrier photo-generation and extraction to occur efficiently. The most efficient polymer:fullerene devices comprising narrow optical gap donor polymers invariably have a high fullerene fraction. In such circumstances photo-generated carrier extraction is compromised, as charge transport is often unbalanced with electron transport in the fullerene dominating. In this current work we study the high efficiency blend system poly(2,5-{2-octyldodecyl}-3,6-diketopyrrolopyrrole-alt-5,5-{2′,5′-di[thien-2-yl]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene}) (DPP–DTT):phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM). We show that by manipulating the packing of the (DPP–DTT) chains, large hole mobilities >0.02 cm2 V−1 s−1 can be obtained in a simple polymer-only diode. More importantly, when blended with PC70BM in a 1 : 3 ratio the hole mobility was found to increase to 0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1. This is the first case of a polymer:fullerene solar cell where the charge carrier transport is limited by the electron mobility of the fullerene rather than the hole mobility of the donor material. Photophysical measurements reveal that the charge generation quantum yield is also enhanced when the DPP–DTT chains are optimally packed. The simultaneous improvement of the charge transport properties and charge generation quantum yield delivers an order of magnitude increase in the power conversion efficiency."
623,Simultaneous inferences: new method of maximum combination,A. Andrés;M. Hernández,Statistical Papers,"The Scheffé method is used to carry out simultaneous inferences on many linear combinations of \(K\) parameters. Frequently these combinations arise from the need to explain the causes of significance of the homogeneity test for all the parameters. This paper proposes an alternative methodology based on the maximization of the contrast statistic in the coefficient of the combination. This new method, compatible with Scheffé’s method, in addition yields the statistic which should be used for the global test, as well as the combination of maximum significance. The method is illustrated in the cases of \(K\) means of normal distributions and \(K\) binomial proportions (independent samples). In the second case, the method allows a homogeneity test that is more powerful than Pearson’s classic chi-squared test to be obtained. The program which determines this may be obtained at http://www.ugr.es/local/bioest/Z_LINEAR_K.EXE."

Salin,Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics,"In the subpicosecond time domain, the characterization and the control of ultrashort light pulses produced by means of femtosecond lasers are important problems. The low repetition rate of laser sources makes classical characterization methods, such as multishot autocorrelators, difficult to use. New different single-shot measurements of the temporal profile and of phase shifts introduced by nonlinear optical phenomena on femtosecond pulses are reported. These techniques are based on spatio-temporal and spectro-temporal transformations."

626,"Site selection for drinking-water pumping boreholes using a fuzzy spatial decision support system in the Korinthia prefecture, SE Greece",A. Antonakos;K. Voudouris;N. Lambrakis,Hydrogeology Journal,"The implementation of a geographic information system (GIS)/fuzzy spatial decision support system in the selection of sites for drinking-water pumping boreholes is described. Groundwater is the main source of domestic supply and irrigation in Korinthia prefecture, south-eastern Greece. Water demand has increased considerably over the last 30 years and is mainly met by groundwater abstracted via numerous wells and boreholes. The definition of the most “suitable” site for the drilling of new boreholes is a major issue in this area. A method of allocating suitable locations has been developed based on multicriteria analysis and fuzzy logic. Twelve parameters were finally involved in the model, prearranged into three categories: borehole yield, groundwater quality, and economic and technical constraints. GIS was used to create a classification map of the research area, based on the suitability of each point for the placement of new borehole fields. The coastal part of the study area is completely unsuitable, whereas high values of suitability are recorded in the south-western part. The study demonstrated that the method of multicriteria analysis in combination with fuzzy logic is a useful tool for selecting the best sites for new borehole drilling on a regional scale. The results could be used by local authorities and decision-makers for integrated groundwater resources management. La mise en œuvre d’un système d’information géographique (SIG)/système spatialisée de logique floue d’aide à la décision pour la sélection de sites de forages d’eau potable est décrite. Les eaux souterraines constituent la principale source d’approvisionnement en eau pour des usages domestiques et agricoles (irrigation) dans la préfecture de Corinthe, dans le Sud-Est de la Grèce. La demande en eau a augmenté de manière considérable au cours des 30 dernières années et est principalement satisfaite par le prélèvement d’eaux souterraines au niveau de nombreux puits et forages. La définition de l’emplacement le plus approprié pour le forage de nouveaux puits est une question centrale dans ce domaine. Une méthode de sélection des sites appropriés a été développée sur la base de l’analyse multicritère et la logique floue. Douze paramètres ont finalement été considérés dans le modèle, arrangés selon trois catégories: le rendement du forage, la qualité des eaux souterraines, et les contraintes économiques et techniques. Le SIG a été utilisé pour créer une carte de classification au niveau de la zone de recherche, sur la base de la pertinence de chaque point pour la localisation de nouveaux champs de captage. La partie côtière de la zone d’étude est totalement inadaptée, alors que les valeurs élevée d’aptitudes sont enregistrées dans la partie sud-ouest. L’étude a démontré que la méthode d’analyse multicritère combinée à la logique floue est un outil utile pour la sélection des meilleurs sites pour implanter de nouveaux forages à l’échelle régionale. Les résultats pourraient être utilisés par les autorités locales et les décideurs pour une gestion intégrée des ressources en eau souterraine. Se describe la implementación de un sistema de información geográfica (GIS)/sistema de apoyo a la toma de decisiones espaciales difusas en la selección de sitios para perforaciones de bombeo de agua potable. El agua subterránea en la principal fuente de abastecimiento doméstico e irrigación en la prefectura de Korinthia, sudeste de Grecia. La demanda de agua se ha incrementado considerablemente durante los últimos 30 años y está principalmente satisfecha por el agua subterránea extraída por numerosos pozos y perforaciones. La definición del sitio más adecuado para las perforaciones de nuevos pozos es un tema mayor en esta área. Se ha desarrollado un método para la ubicación apropiada de las locaciones basado en análisis de multicriterio y lógica difusa. Doce parámetros fueron finalmente involucrados en el modelo, preestablecidos en tres categorías: rendimiento de la perforación, calidad de agua subterránea, y limitantes técnicas y económicas. Se usó el GIS para crear un mapa de clasificación del área investigada, basado en la pertinencia de cada uno de los puntos para la ubicación de nuevos campos de pozos. La parte costera del área de estudio es completamente inadecuada, mientras que se han registrado valores altos de oportunidad en la parte sudoeste. El estudio demostró que el método de análisis multicriterio en combinación con la lógica difusa es una herramienta útil para seleccionar los mejores sitios para las nuevas perforaciones en escala regional. Los resultados podrían ser usados por autoridades locales y por tomadores de decisión para el manejo integrado de los recursos de agua subterránea. 本文论述了饮用水抽水井场地选择中地理信息系统/模糊空间决策支持系统的应用。在希腊东南部Korinthia地区,地下水是家庭供水和灌溉用水的主要水源。最近30年水需求大幅增加,主要靠从众多的钻井中抽取地下水来满足需求。确定新钻井最合适的场地是本地区一个主要问题。根据多评价指标分析和模糊逻辑开发了配置合适位置的方法。模型最终涉及到12个参数,分为三类:井出水量、地下水质和经济技术约束条件。根据每个点新井场配置的适宜性,利用地理信息系统编制了研究区分类图。研究区的沿海区域完全不适宜,而适宜性高的地区为研究区的西南部。研究显示,多评价标准分析方法结合模糊逻辑方法在选择区域尺度上的钻井最佳场地中是一个有用的工具。最终结果可供当地政府和决策者用于地下水资源综合管理。 Στην παρούσα έρευνα παρουσιάζεται η εφαρμογή των γεωγραφικών συστημάτων πληροφοριών σε συνδυασμό με ένα Χωρικό Σύστημα Υποστήριξης Αποφάσεων, βασισμένο σε ασαφή λογική, για την επιλογή κατάλληλων θέσεων ανόρυξης νέων υδρομαστευτικών έργων. Το υπόγειο νερό είναι η κύρια πηγή για την κάλυψη των υδρευτικών και αρδευτικών αναγκών του νομού Κορινθίας στο νοτιανατολικό τμήμα της Ελλάδας.

Οι κατηγορίες αφορούσαν κριτήρια απόδοσης, κριτήρια ποιότητας και οικονομοτεχνικά κριτήρια. Γεωγραφικά Συστήματα Πληροφοριών (GIS) χρησιμοποιήθηκαν για την παραγωγή ενός χάρτη κατανομής της καταλληλότητας για την ανόρυξη νέων γεωτρήσεων στην περιοχή έρευνας. Το παράκτιο τμήμα της περιοχής έρευνας φαίνεται να είναι σχεδόν εξ ολοκλήρου ακατάλληλο για την ανόρυξη νέων παραγωγικών γεωτρήσεων, ενώ κατάλληλες θέσεις παρουσιάζει το νοτιοδυτικό τμήμα της περιοχής. Η παρούσα έρευνα κατέδειξε ότι η χρήση πολυκριτηριακής ανάλυσης σε συνδυασμό με ασαφή λογική μπορεί να αποτελέσει ένα ιδιαίτερα χρήσιμο εργαλείο για την επιλογή βέλτιστων θέσεων για την ανόρυξη νέων γεωτρήσεων σε περιφερειακή κλίμακα. Τα αποτελέσματα της μεθόδου μπορούν να χρησιμοποιηθούν από τους αρμόδιους φορείς στο πλαίσιο μιας ολοκληρωμένης πολιτικής διαχείρισης των υδατικών πόρων μιας περιοχής. Descreve-se a implementação de um sistema de informação geográfica (GIS)/sistema de apoio à decisão espacial difusa na seleção de locais para poços de bombeamento de água potável. A água subterrânea é a principal fonte de abastecimento doméstico e para rega no município de Korinthia, sudeste da Grécia. A procura de água tem aumentado consideravelmente ao longo dos últimos 30 anos e é satisfeita principalmente por água subterrânea captada através de inúmeros poços e furos. A definição do local mais apropriado para a perfuração de novos poços é uma questão importante nesta área. Um método de alocação de locais adequados foi desenvolvido com base na análise multicritério e lógica difusa. Doze parâmetros foram finalmente envolvidos no modelo, previamente combinados em três categorias: rendimento do furo, qualidade das águas subterrâneas e restrições económicas e técnicas. Um SIG foi utilizado para criar um mapa de classificação da área de pesquisa, com base na aptidão de cada ponto para a implantação de novos campos de furos. A parte costeira da área de estudo é completamente inadequada, enquanto altos valores de adequação são registados na parte sudoeste. O estudo demonstrou que o método de análise multicritério, em combinação com a lógica difusa, é uma ferramenta útil para selecionar, numa escala regional, os melhores locais para nova abertura de furos. Os resultados podem ser utilizados pelas autoridades locais e tomadores de decisão para a gestão integrada dos recursos hídricos subterrâneos."
627,Size Exclusion Redox‐Labeled Immunoassay (SERI): A New Format for Homogeneous Amperometric Creatinine Determination,A. Benkert;F. Scheller;W. Schoessler;B. Micheel;A. Warsinke,Electroanalysis,"A homogeneous amperometric immunoassay for creatinine has been developed by using anti‐creatinine antibodies, redox‐labeled creatinine and a glassy carbon electrode covered with a semipermeable cellulose membrane with 20 kD cutoff. Creatinine from the sample competes with redox‐labeled creatinine for the antigen binding sites of the antibody. Unbound conjugate passes through the membrane and is indicated at the electrode whereas antibody bound conjugate is size excluded. For redox labeling of creatinine a new labeling substance, 2‐acetamido‐3‐chloro‐1,4‐naphthoquinone (AcClNQ), was used, which can be indicated electrochemically at an interference free working potential of – 200 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl). With the developed size exclusion redox‐labeled immunoassay (SERI) creatinine can be determined within a range from 10 ng/mL to 100 µg/mL (0.09–900 µM)."
628,Size distribution of supernova remnants and the interstellar medium: the case of M 33,A. Asvarov,Astronomy & Astrophysics,"The size distribution of supernova remnants (SNRs) can help to clarify the various aspects of their evolution and interaction with the interstellar medium (ISM). Since the observed samples of SNRs are a collection of objects with very different ages and origin that evolve in different conditions of the ISM, statistical Monte Carlo methods can be used to model their statistical distributions. Based on very general assumptions on the evolution, we have modeled samples of SNRs at various initial and environmental conditions, which were then compared with observed collections of SNRs. In the evolution of SNRs the pressure of the ISM is taken into account, which determines their maximum sizes and lifetimes. When comparing the modeled and observed distributions, it is very important to have homogeneous observational data free from selection effects. We found that a recently published collection of SNRs in M 33 satisfies this requirement if we select the X-ray SNRs with hardness ratios in a limited range of values. An excellent agreement between distributions of this subset of SNRs and the subset of modeled SNRs was reached for a volume filling-factor of the warm phase of the ISM (partly ionized gas with nH ~ 0.2−0.5 cm-3; T ~ 8000−10 000 K) in M 33 of ~90%. The statistical distributions constructed in this way, which reproduce practically all the statistical properties of observed SNRs, allowed us to obtain one of the important parameters of M 33: the birthrate is one SNR every 140−150 yr, and the total number of SNRs with a shock Mach number Ms ≥ 2 is larger than ~1000."
629,Size-exclusion HPLC as a sensitive and calibrationless method for complex peptide mixtures quantification,A. Bodin;X. Framboisier;D. Alonso;I. Marc;R. Kapel,Journal of Chromatography B,"This work describes an original methodology to quantify complex peptide mixtures by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC). The methodology was first tested on simulated elutions of peptide mixtures. For this set of experiments, a good estimation of the total peptide concentration was observed (error less than 10 %). Then 30 fractions obtained by ultrafiltration of hydrolysates from two different sources were titrated by Kjeldahl or BCA analysis and analysed by SE-HPLC for an experimental validation of the methodology. Very good matchs between methods were obtained. The linear working range depends on the hydrolysate but is generally between 0.2 and 4 g L−1 (i.e. between 10 and 200 μg). Moreover, the presence of organic solvents or salts in samples does not impact the accuracy of the methodology contrary to common quantification methods. Hence, the findings of this study show that total concentration of complex peptide mixture can be efficiently determinate by the proposed methodology using simple SE-HPLC analysis.Peptide mixtures quantification by size exclusion chromatography coupled with UV.Use of mixture aminogram to determine molar extinction coefficients along profiles.Method alternative to Kjeldahl analysis or colorimetric assays.Faster method that does not require calibration for each type of hydrolysate.This work describes an original methodology to quantify complex peptide mixtures by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC).

630,Sleep behavior assessment via smartwatch and stigmergic receptive fields,A. Alfeo;P. Barsocchi;M. Cimino;D. Rosa;F. Palumbo;G. Vaglini,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,"Sleep behavior is a key factor in maintaining good physiological and psychological health. A well-known approach to monitor sleep is polysomnography. However, it is costly and intrusive, which may disturb sleep. Consequently, polysomnography is not suitable for sleep behavior analysis. Other approaches are based on actigraphy and sleep diary. Although being a good source of information for sleep quality assessment, sleep diaries can be affected by cognitive bias related to subject’s sleep perception, while actigraphy overestimates sleep periods and night-time disturbance compared to sleep diaries. Machine learning techniques can improve the objectivity and reliability of the observations. However, since signal morphology vary widely between people, conventional machine learning is complex to set up. In this regard, we present an adaptive, reliable, and innovative computational approach to provide per-night assessment of sleep behavior to the end-user. We exploit heartbeat rate and wrist acceleration data, gathered via smartwatch, in order to identify subject’s sleep behavioral pattern. More specifically, heartbeat rate and wrist motion samples are processed via computational stigmergy, a bio-inspired scalar and temporal aggregation of samples. Stigmergy associates each sample to a digital pheromone deposit (mark) defined in a mono-dimensional space and characterized by evaporation over time. As a consequence, samples close in terms of time and intensity are aggregated into functional structures called trails. The stigmergic trails allow to compute the similarity between time series on different temporal scales, to support classification or clustering processes. The overall computing schema includes a parametric optimization for adapting the structural parameters to individual sleep dynamics. The outcome is a similarity between sleep nights of the same subject, to generate clusters of nights with different quality levels. Experimental results are shown for three real-world subjects. The resulting similarity is also compared with the dynamic time warping, a popular similarity measure for time series."
631,Small Molecule Probes of Cellular Pathways and Networks,A. Castoreno;U. Eggert,ACS Chemical Biology,Small molecules are important not only as therapeutics to treat disease but also as chemical tools to probe complex biological processes. The discovery of novel bioactive small molecules has largely been catalyzed by screening diverse chemical libraries for alterations in specific activities in pure proteins assays or in generating cell-based phenotypes. New approaches are needed to close the vast gap between the ability to study either single proteins or whole cellular processes. This Review focuses on the growing number of studies aimed at understanding in more detail how small molecules perturb particular signaling pathways and larger networks to yield distinct cellular phenotypes. This type of pathway-level analysis and phenotypic profiling provides valuable insight into mechanistic action of small molecules and can reveal off-target effects and improve our understanding of how proteins within a pathway regulate signaling.
632,Small droplet formation in a pneumatic drop-on-demand generator: Experiments and analysis,A. Amirzadeh;S. Chandra,Experimental Thermal and Fluid Science,"A pneumatic droplet generator is described in which a gas pulse of alternating negative and positive pressure is applied on liquid in a nozzle, driving a periodic motion of the free liquid surface. An analytic model of incompressible liquid motion in the nozzle demonstrates that the motion of the surface is out of phase with the exciting pressure oscillation. A jet of liquid issues far enough out of the nozzle that its tip becomes unstable, detaches and forms a droplet. Experiments showed the oscillation of the liquid surface prior to droplet ejection and the time lag between the pressure oscillation and droplet ejection. The model predicts that maximum liquid velocity is attained at an intermediate value of viscosity, and experiments confirmed that the largest liquid motion was achieved with this intermediate value, which eventually leads to droplet formation. By varying the duration of the pressure pulse droplets smaller than the nozzle diameter could be produced.A pneumatic droplet generator is described in which a gas pulse of alternating negative and positive pressure is applied on liquid in a nozzle, driving a periodic motion of the free liquid surface.

Harej;M. Sedić;S. Kraljević-Pavelić;S. Koštrun;J. Plavec;D. Makuc;S. Raić-Malić,Journal of Enzyme Inhibition and Medicinal Chemistry,"Novel halogenated purines and pseudopurines with diverse aryl-substituted 1,2,3-triazoles were prepared. While p-(trifluoromethyl)-substituted 1,2,3-triazole in N-9 alkylated purine and 3-deazapurine was critical for strong albeit unselective activity on pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells CFPAC-1,1-(p-fluorophenyl)-1,2,3-triazole derivative of 7-deazapurine showed selective cytostatic effect on metastatic colon cancer cells SW620. Importantly, 1-(p-chlorophenyl)-1,2,3-triazole-tagged benzimidazole displayed the most pronounced and highly selective inhibitory effect in nM range on non-small cell lung cancer A549. This compound revealed to target molecular processes at the extracellular side and inside the plasma membrane regulated by GPLD1 and growth factor receptors PDGFR and IGF-1R leading to the inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis mediated by p38 MAP kinase and NF-κB, respectively. Further optimisation of this compound as to reduce its toxicity in normal cells may lead to the development of novel agent effective against lung cancer.Graphical Abstract"

Eggert,Nature Chemical Biology,"We report the discovery of small molecules that target the Rho pathway, which is a central regulator of cytokinesis—the final step in cell division. We have developed a way of targeting a small molecule screen toward a specific pathway, which should be widely applicable to the investigation of any signaling pathway. In a chemical genetic variant of a classical modifier screen, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to sensitize cells and identified small molecules that suppressed or enhanced the RNAi phenotype. We discovered promising candidate molecules, which we named Rhodblock 1–8, and we identified the target of Rhodblock 6 as Rho kinase. Several Rhodblocks inhibited one function of the Rho pathway in cells: the correct localization of phosphorylated myosin light chain during cytokinesis. Rhodblocks differentially perturb Rho pathway proteins in cells and can be used to dissect the mechanism of the Rho pathway during cytokinesis.We report the discovery of small molecules that target the Rho pathway, which is a central regulator of cytokinesis—the final step in cell division.

Lara,Colloid and Polymer Science,"Two different asphaltenes, separated from a crude oil and a deposit both from the same well, were solubilized in toluene and in tetrahydrofuran, at several contact times. The concentration of asphaltene was below 0.03% w/w, which was assumed to be the critical micelle concentration. Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements provided the structural parameters, which indicate that the shape, the particle size and the fractal dimension are determined by the duration of the contact time between asphaltenes and the solvent."
636,Smart antenna technologies for future wireless systems: trends and challenges,A. Alexiou;M. Haardt,IEEE Communications Magazine,"The adaptation of smart antenna techniques in future wireless systems is expected to have a significant impact on the efficient use of the spectrum, the minimization of the cost of establishing new wireless networks, the optimization of service quality, and realization of the transparent operation across multitechnology wireless networks. Nevertheless, its success relies on two considerations that have been often overlooked when investigating smart antenna technologies: first, the smart antennas features need to be considered early in the design phase of future systems (top-down compatibility); second, a realistic performance evaluation of smart antenna technique needs to be performed according to the critical parameters associated with future systems requirements (bottom-up feasibility). In this article an overview of the benefits of and most recent advances in smart antenna transceiver architecture is given first. Then the most important trends in the adoption of smart antennas in future system are presented, such as reconfigurability to varying channel propagation and network conditions, cross-layer optimization, and multi-user diversity, as well as challenges such as the design of a suitable simulation methodology and the accurate modeling of channel characteristics, interference, and implementation losses. Finally, market trends, future projections, and the expected financial impact of smart antenna systems deployment are discussed."
637,Smoothened Regulation: A Tale of Two Signals,A. Arensdorf;S. Marada;S. Ogden,Trends in Pharmacological Sciences,"Recent structural information reveals how ligands bind and regulate Smoothened.Smoothened signaling is regulated by its trafficking within the primary cilium.Smoothened can signal through G protein-dependent and -independent mechanisms.The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Smoothened (Smo) is the signal transducer of the developmentally and therapeutically relevant Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. Although recent structural analyses have advanced our understanding of Smo biology, several questions remain. Chief among them are the identity of its natural ligand, the regulatory processes controlling its activation, and the mechanisms by which it signals to downstream effectors. In this review, we discuss recent discoveries from multiple model systems that have set the stage for solving these mysteries. We focus on the roles of distinct Smo functional domains, post-translational modifications, and trafficking, and conclude by discussing their contributions to signal output."
638,Sn ion energy distributions of ns- and ps-laser produced plasmas,A. Bayerle;M. Deuzeman;S. Heijden;D. Kurilovich;T. Pinto;A. Stodolna;S. Witte;K. Eikema;W. Ubachs;R. Hoekstra;O. Versolato,ArXiv Physics,Ion energy distributions arising from laser-produced plasmas of Sn are measured over a wide laser parameter space. Planar-solid as well as liquid-droplet targets are exposed to infrared laser pulses with energy densities between 1J/cm$^2$ and 4kJ/cm$^2$ and durations spanning 0.5ps to 6ns. The measured ion energy distributions are compared to two self-similar solutions of a hydrodynamic approach assuming isothermal expansion of the plasma plume into vacuum. For planar and droplet targets exposed to ps-long pulses we find a good agreement between the experimental results and the self-similar solution of a semi-infinite simple planar plasma configuration with an exponential density profile. The ion energy distributions resulting from solid Sn exposed to ns-pulses agrees with solutions of a limited-mass model that assumes a Gaussian-shaped initial density profile.
639,Snail Problems in African Schistosomiasis,A. Berrie,Advances in Parasitology,"Schistosomiasis is considered to be the second most important parasitic disease affecting man. The name of the species of mammalian schistosomes, their intermediate hosts, their usual definitive hosts, and their geographic distribution in Africa are tabulated in this chapter. The taxonomy and distribution of the African snails is also discussed. In the south and west of the African continent, Schistosomiasis mattheei (S. mattheei) replaces S. bovis but the morphological similarity of their spindle-shaped eggs causes considerable problems in identification. Further problems arise because a number of factors are known to cause variation in the shape of schistosome eggs and it can be difficult to identify the African species, other than S. mansoni and S. rodhaini, on the basis of egg shape alone. An important problem in studying naturally infected snails is that there is no reliable method of distinguishing the cercariae of the different mammalian schistosomes. Progress has been made in studying populations of cercariae by the indirect method of exposing laboratory animals in the natural habitats and using the resulting infection rates and worm burdens as an assessment of the transmission potential of the habitat at the time of exposure. This disposes off the problems caused by turbidity and of identifying the cercariae and, epidemiologically, has the advantage of detecting only those cercariae, which are infective."
640,Social inequities in vaccination coverage among infants and pre-school children in Europe and Australia – a systematic review,A. Arat;B. Burström;V. Östberg;A. Hjern,BMC Public Health,"Background Herd immunity levels of vaccine uptake are still not reached in some high-income countries, usually in countries with persisting social inequities in uptake. Previous studies have focused on factors within one health care system. This study takes a broader health care systems approach by reviewing the socioeconomic distribution of vaccination coverage on the national level in light of structural and organizational differences of primary care for children. Methods A systematic literature review of socio-economic patterns of uptake of Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) and/or Diphteria-Tetanus-Pertusis (DTP) in population based studies of children 0–5 years of age living in the 30 European Economic Area (EEA) or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries and Australia, was carried out using the PRISMA guidelines. The health care system in the countries in the study were categorized by degree of freedom of the primary care provider (hierarchical or non-hierarchical) and whether preventive services were provided in a separate organization (well-baby clinics). Results The review identified 15 studies from 10 European countries and Australia that fulfilled the criteria. Although the heterogeneity of the socio-economic indicators did not allow for a conclusive meta-analysis, the study pointed towards lower levels of inequities in primary care models with well-baby clinics. In non-hierarchical primary care organizations that also lacked well-baby clinics, socioeconomic gaps in uptake were often found to be large. Conclusion This review indicates that structural and organizational aspects of health care systems for young children are important for equity in vaccine uptake."

Kleesiek,Scientific Reports (Immunology),"The cascade of inflammatory pathogenetic mechanisms in multiple sclerosis (MS) has no specific conventional MRI correlates. Clinicians therefore stipulate improved imaging specificity to define the pathological substrates of MS in vivo including mapping of intracellular sodium accumulation. Based upon preclinical findings and results of previous sodium MRI studies in MS patients we hypothesized that the fluid-attenuated sodium signal differs between acute and chronic lesions. We acquired brain sodium and proton MRI data of N = 29 MS patients; lesion type was defined by the presence or absence of contrast enhancement. N = 302 MS brain lesions were detected, and generalized linear mixed models were applied to predict lesion type based on sodium signals; thereby controlling for varying numbers of lesions among patients and confounding variables such as age and medication. Hierarchical model comparisons revealed that both sodium signals average tissue (χ2(1) = 27.89, p < 0.001) and fluid-attenuated (χ2(1) = 5.76, p = 0.016) improved lesion type classification. Sodium MRI signals were significantly elevated in acute compared to chronic lesions compatible with intracellular sodium accumulation in acute MS lesions. If confirmed in further studies, sodium MRI could serve as biomarker for diagnostic assessment of MS, and as readout parameter in clinical trials promoting attenuation of chronic inflammation.The cascade of inflammatory pathogenetic mechanisms in multiple sclerosis (MS) has no specific conventional MRI correlates.

642,Softening the ultra-stiff: Controlled variation of Young's modulus in single-crystal diamond by ion implantation,A. Battiato;M. Lorusso;E. Bernardi;F. Picollo;P. Olivero,Acta Materialia,"A combined experimental and numerical study on the variation of the elastic properties of defective single-crystal diamond is presented for the first time, by comparing nano-indentation measurements on MeV-ion-implanted samples with multi-scale modeling consisting of both ab initio atomistic calculations and meso-scale Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. It is found that by locally introducing defects in the 2 × 1018–5 × 1021 cm−3 density range, a significant reduction of Young’s modulus, as well as of density, can be induced in the diamond crystal structure without incurring in the graphitization of the material. Ab initio atomistic simulations confirm the experimental findings with a good degree of confidence. FEM simulations are further employed to verify the consistency of measured deformations with a stiffness reduction, and to derive strain and stress levels in the implanted region. Combining these experimental and numerical results, we also provide insight into the mechanism responsible for the depth dependence of the graphitization threshold in diamond. This work prospects the possibility of achieving accurate tunability of the mechanical properties of single-crystal diamond through defect engineering, with significant technological applications, e.g. the fabrication and control of the resonant frequency of diamond-based micromechanical resonators.A combined experimental and numerical study on the variation of the elastic properties of defective single-crystal diamond is presented for the first time, by comparing nano-indentation measurements on MeV-ion-implanted samples with multi-scale modeling consisting of both ab initio atomistic calculations and meso-scale Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations.

643,Soil microbial community assembly precedes vegetation development after drastic techniques to mitigate effects of nitrogen deposition,A. Bij;M. Pawlett;J. Harris;K. Ritz;R. Diggelen,Biological Conservation,"Oligotrophic semi-natural systems are threatened by high levels of nitrogen deposition. To mitigate these effects, drastic techniques such as sod-cutting and topsoil removal are applied to reduce nitrogen loads in existing systems and expand their area on former agricultural fields. We assessed the effects of these techniques along with the influence of previous land-use, isolation and vegetation development on subsequent microbial community assembly in restored agricultural areas. Microbial community phenotypic structure was measured using PLFA-analysis, along with soil chemistry and vegetation development. Differences in soil nitrogen pools due to restoration techniques were the most differentiating factor for both microbial community assembly and vegetation development. Only after topsoil removal was resemblance of both below- and above-ground communities to well-developed heathlands increased within 10–15 years. After sod-cutting both microbial community and vegetation composition remained more similar to agricultural sites. The relative contribution of agricultural sites and heathlands in the direct vicinity had more pronounced effects on local microbial community composition than current land-use in all study sites including agricultural areas and heathlands. Vegetation development was apparently of minor importance for microbial community assembly, since characteristic belowground assembly preceded that of aboveground development in both restoration contexts.Sod-cutting and topsoil removal are drastic techniques to remove excess nitrogen.Soil nitrogen pools are the dominant factor for microbial community assembly.Similarity to the target system increases only after topsoil removal.Community composition across different systems is affected by the local species pool.Belowground assembly precedes aboveground development after both techniques.Oligotrophic semi-natural systems are threatened by high levels of nitrogen deposition.

644,Soil reinforcement provided by the root system of grapevines: Quantification and spatial variability,A. Cislaghi;M. Bordoni;C. Meisina;G. Bischetti,Ecological Engineering,"Rainfall-induced shallow landslides represent a major threat for cultivated steep terrain, including vineyards that are typically established on hillslopes. Vineyards represent high-value cultivation in many countries; there is a tendency to adopt new and more intensive cultivation practices and/or to extend plantations to inappropriate sites, which influences the natural environment. Considerable damage thus increasingly affects vineyards in terms of partial or total destruction of cultivation, structures and infrastructures, as well as the surrounding landscape. However, little research has been conducted to date to investigate the role of grapevine plants on slope stability and to reduce the related impacts on the environment.Aiming to help fill the gap, we carried out a study to quantify the role of vineyards on slope stability by modelling the additional reinforcement to the soil provided by grapevine roots and their spatial distribution (i.e. considering the distance from the trunk) using the Root Bundle Model. A back analysis on a number of shallow landslides that occurred in vineyards was also conducted to validate the results. The area of our investigation was in the northeastern part of Oltrepò Pavese, Northern Italy, which is a hilly terrain cultivated for many decades with vineyards and prone to landslide phenomena that in recent years have caused great economic losses to the agricultural sector and damage to buildings and roads. Moreover, abandoned vineyards represent an issue in terms of their “return” to a natural stateValues simulated by modelling and back-calculated from the landslide inventory completely agree and are in the range of reinforcements commonly obtained for many other species. However, in contrast to native species, the spatial variability of the reinforcement in the case of vineyards is lower because of the regularity of planting and the lack of differences in plant age. Additionally, the variability of the rooting depth is negligible because it is controlled by the rootstock.Finally, the results obtained in this work show that the models developed for native species can also be adopted for grapevines and, if coupled with a slope stability model, represent a basis for providing guidelines to design vineyard plantations in those areas susceptible to instability, to support decisions concerning land management and land use change and more generally to reduce environmental impacts."
645,"Solution structure of the PHD domain from the KAP‐1 corepressor: structural determinants for PHD, RING and LIM zinc‐binding domains",A. Capili;D. Schultz;F. Rauscher;K. Borden,EMBO Journal,"Plant homeodomain (PHD) domains are found in &gt;400 eukaryotic proteins, many of which are transcriptional regulators. Naturally occurring point mutations or deletions of this domain contribute to a variety of human diseases, including ATRX syndrome, myeloid leukemias and autoimmune dysfunction. Here we report the first structural characterization of a PHD domain. Our studies reveal that the PHD domain from KAP‐1 corepressor binds zinc in a cross‐brace topology between anti‐parallel β‐strands reminiscent of RING (really interesting new gene) domains. Using a mutational analysis, we define the structural features required for transcriptional repression by KAP‐1 and explain naturally occurring, disease‐causing mutations in PHD domains of other proteins. From a comparison of this PHD structure with previously reported RING and LIM (Lin11/Isl‐1/Mec‐3) structures, we infer sequence determinants that allow discrimination among PHD, RING and LIM motifs."

Wieczorek,Journal of Organic Chemistry,The synthesis of the novel compound PhCH2SS(C24H44N4O10)(C20H41) (5) for the preparation of tethered bilayer membranes is described. The compound is the all-amide analogue of the previously reported ester-containing membrane-forming material PhCH2SS(C24H40O14)(C20H41) (1). The advanced intermediate (C20H41) C16H28N3O8 (17) was prepared from the same starting materials using both solution-phase (13% yield) and solid-phase (81% yield) techniques. Monolayers on gold derived from 5 have been analyzed by ellipsometry and FTIR. The monolayers exhibit thicknesses similar to monolayers derived from 1 and possess H-bonded amide functionality.
647,Solvability of a model for monomer–monomer surface reactions,A. Ambrazevičius;V. Skakauskas,Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications,A mathematical model for a monomer–monomer surface reaction is considered taking into account the surface diffusion of adsorbed particles of both reactants. The model is described by a coupled system of parabolic equations where some of them are defined in a domain and the other ones have to be solved on the domain surface. The existence and uniqueness theorem of a classic solution for the time-dependent problem is proved. Non-uniqueness of solutions for the steady-state problem is established.A mathematical model for a monomer–monomer surface reaction is considered taking into account the surface diffusion of adsorbed particles of both reactants.

648,Some cues are more equal than others: Cue plausibility for false alarms in baggage screening,A. Chavaillaz;A. Schwaninger;S. Michel;J. Sauer,Applied Ergonomics,"This study investigated the effects of cue plausibility in a baggage screening task. 120 participants had to indicate whether a prohibited item was present in a series of grey-scaled X-ray images of baggage. They were assisted by a support system, which pointed at the location of a suspicious object. A 2 × 2 × 2 between-subjects design was used. Cue plausibility for false alarms (i.e. how the cued object was similar to a prohibited item) and support system reliability were manipulated at two levels (high/low). Furthermore, half of participants were provided with a rationale about automation failures (RAF) to reduce their negative impact on trust and performance. The results showed lower performance and more compliance with automation suggestions when cues were implausible than plausible. The RAF increased the response time and did not improve detection performance. Overall, this suggests that effective (computer-based) training is needed to reduce the negative effect of plausible cues."
649,Some remarks concerning theories with recursively enumerable complements,A. Cobham,Journal of Symbolic Logic,"A system formalized within the first order predicate calculus either with or without the identity but without predicate or function variables we call simply a theory. We say that a theory T has a recursively enumerable complement (r.e. Comp.) if the set of all sentences of T not valid in T is recursively enumerable. This is equivalent to saying that there exists an effective, purely mechanical procedure for establishing the non-validity in T of precisely those sentences of T which are in fact not theorems of T. If in addition T is recursively enumerable, that is, if there is an effective procedure for establishing the validity in T of its theorems, then T is decidable. It will be shown here that several well-known results concerning decidable theories can be extended to cover theories with r.e. comps. In this respect it should be observed that there exist theories having r.e. comps. which are not decidable. An example is the theory which has as valid sentences just those which contain a given two-place predicate and which are valid in all non-void finite universes [3], [4]."
650,Sorption of phenol by modified schungites,A. Akimbaeva,Petroleum Chemistry,"The sorption properties of schungite and its aminated form for phenol extracted from its one-component solutions and solutions in the presence of organic admixtures were examined depending on the carbon content of schungite samples and the phenol concentration in solution. It was shown that the modification of the schungite surface by the introduction of amino groups results in the formation of new sorption sites and porosity, thus enhancing the removal of phenol from its solutions."

Ballestero,American Ethnologist,"Sounding the Limits of Life is a collection of 14 essays, many of which have been previously published but have been revised for this book. Given the richness and diversity of topics that the essays address, this reviewer will engage with their crosscutting themes, with the book's structure, and mostly with the methodological and analytic contributions it makes. Stefan Helmreich tells us that the book explores “how one might think about the relation between the abstract, the empirical, the formal, and the material—a relation that in no way is always working in one direction, in one order” (xxii). Said exploration unfolds around three fundamental categories of our times: life, water, and sound."
652,Sources and Mycoflora associated with some sundried vegetables in storage,A. Adebanjo;E. Shopeju,International Biodeterioration and Biodegradation,"The sources and mycoflora of the following sundried, preserved vegetables: Abelmoschus esculentus, Corchorus olitorius, Solanum macrocarpon and Capsicum annum were investigated. The major fungal flora of the stored vegetables over a period of 8 weeks were Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, A. fumigatus, Rhizopus oryaze, Penicillium oxalicum, Rhizomucor pusillus and Fusarium equiseti however, the mycoflora isolated from the fresh vegetables and after sundrying differed. Some micro-organisms were isolated immediately after sundrying and throughout storage. There was also evidence of field acquisition of some of these species which were carried into storage. Also, post-harvest contaminants, handling, air spora during sundrying and storage fungi were other sources of contamination of these vegetables."
653,Spatial Vision in Bombus terrestris,A. Chakravarthi;E. Baird;M. Dacke;A. Kelber,Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience,"Bombus terrestris is one of the most commonly used insect models to investigate visually guided behavior and spatial vision in particular. Two fundamental measures of spatial vision are spatial resolution and contrast sensitivity. In this study, we report the threshold of spatial resolution in B. terrestris and characterize the contrast sensitivity function of the bumblebee visual system for a dual choice discrimination task. We trained bumblebees in a Y-maze experimental set-up to associate a vertical sinusoidal grating with a sucrose reward, and a horizontal grating with absence of a reward. Using a logistic psychometric function, we estimated a resolution threshold of 0.21 cycles deg −1 of visual angle. This resolution is in the same range but slightly lower than that found in honeybees ( Apis mellifera and A. cerana ) and another bumblebee species ( B. impatiens ). We also found that the contrast sensitivity of B. terrestris was 1.57 for the spatial frequency 0.090 cycles deg −1 and 1.26 for 0.18 cycles deg −1 ."
654,"Spatial analysis of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Galicia, Spain (2000–2005)",A. Allepuz;A. López-Quílez;A. Forte;G. Fernández;J. Casal,Preventive Veterinary Medicine,"In Spain, the first bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) case was detected in 2000 in a cow born in the Galicia region (Northwestern Spain). From then and until October 2005, 590 cases were detected, 223 of them in Galicia.In 1994, meat and bone meal (MBM) was banned on ruminant feed and, in 1996, an EU decision mandating an overall change in MBM processing was implemented. This decision was gradually applied in the territory and not enforced before July 1998. The objective of this study was to explore clustering of BSE cases and estimate the standard incidence ratio (SIR) of BSE in Galicia. Our study was based on the BSE cases detected during the surveillance period 2000–2005 in the Galicia region. These cases were divided, based on birth date, into two periods: animals born from 1994 to July 1998, and those born after July 1998. We tested the role of cross-contamination on the geographical SIR distribution for both periods. Hierarchical Bayesian models were used to model the overdispersion and lack of independence of the SIR estimates. The geographical distribution of the standard incidence ratio of BSE between both periods was different. In the second period, the SIR was reduced in some areas. The reduction in these areas could be attributable to the changes in the processing of MBM. We did not find any statistical link between the poultry population and the standard incidence ratio, but pig population had a positive effect."
655,Spatial distribution of insect indicator taxa as a basis for peat bog conservation planning,A. Brigić;J. Bujan;A. Alegro;V. Šegota;I. Ternjej,Ecological Indicators,"Peat bogs are highly endangered ecosystems worldwide. In the Western Balkans, they represent fragmented habitat patches, where insect diversity and implications for the habitat loss are poorly known. Carabid beetles and ants, widely used environmental indicators, were sampled by pitfall trapping in the largest and oldest Croatian peat bog and at its edges. We found that tyrphobiontic—bog specialist—species were absent in both taxonomic groups, which is likely due to biogeographical limitation for dispersal of these species into this region. With this study, tyrphophilous—typical of bogs—species have been recognised as environmental indicators in the Western Balkans peat bogs. Assemblages of both taxa were strongly affected by specific conditions in the peat bog – high soil moisture and Sphagnum moss dominance, showing that edges are more favourable habitats for both taxa. Overall, carabid beetle activity density was significantly higher at the edge than at the peat bog, while species richness increased for both taxa at the edge, but not significantly. Spatial distribution of tyrphophilous species differed between studied taxa, with ants being more abundant in the peat bog, and carabid beetles at the edge. Additionally, some stenotopic and globally endangered species preferred edges. Occurrence of tyrphophilous and globally endangered species highlights the great conservation value of peat bog habitats in the Western Balkans. However, successional changes in vegetation are changing hydrological conditions of the peat bog. Here we suggest active conservation measures to preserve these unique soil invertebrate zoocoenoses.Spatial distribution of carabid beetles and ants is governed by soil moisture and vegetation composition and structure.Edges were more favourable habitats for both taxa.Tyrphophilous ants were more abundant in the peat bog, carabid beetles in the edge.Both habitats are important for conservation of rare and endangered insect taxa.Peat bogs are highly endangered ecosystems worldwide.

656,Spatio-temporal changes of terrestrial isopod assemblages (Isopoda: Oniscidea) in a fen undergoing succession,A. Brigić;J. Bujan;J. Bedek;I. Antonović;R. Kepčija,Pedobiologia,"Peatlands in the Western Balkans are becoming rapidly reduced due to vegetation succession, further enhanced by climate change and abandonment of traditional land management practices. Currently, the peatlands of this region act as habitat islands embedded mainly in a forest landscape matrix. This allows them to host more forest and generalist species of animals and plants than would be expected from such ecosystem. We were interested in testing if a taxon, unspecialized for such extreme habitats, can maintain stable populations in a peatland, and how environmental fluctuations affect its spatio-temporal distributions along a successional gradient. Terrestrial isopods were sampled in four habitat types: a fen, two successional habitats and a beech forest, with pitfall traps during two consecutive years. In total, 1069 individuals belonging to five species were recorded. Activity density increased more than four-fold along the successional gradient, from the fen to an older and more complex successional habitat. This pattern was governed by an increase in the structural complexity of the habitat, where succession habitats supported more favourable shelter sites for terrestrial isopods. Soil moisture decreased over 30% along the successional gradient. Additionally, the older successional habitat was more nutrient rich than the fen, providing higher substrate quality for decomposers and enabling the survival of forest species. The fen was inhabited by a single species, Ligidium germanicum, while other species were extremely rare. Its seasonal activity started in the spring, reaching the maximum in June and decreasing at the end of summer. Spatial changes in isopod assemblages along the successional gradient imply that the groundwater level in the fen was sufficiently high to supress the invasion of forest species into the fen. Colonisation of the fen by terrestrial isopods will likely progress as environmental conditions become more suitable by progressive vegetation succession and climate change."
657,Spatiotemporal distribution of facilitation and inhibition of return arising from the reflexive orienting of covert attention.,A. Collie;P. Maruff;M. Yucel;J. Danckert;J. Currie,Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance,"Currently, there is debate regarding both the spatial and temporal relationship between facilitation and inhibition of return (IOR) components of attention, as observed on the covert orienting of visual attention task (COVAT). These issues were addressed in a series of experiments where the spatial and temporal relationships between cue and target were manipulated. Facilitation occurred only when the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was short and there was temporal overlap between cue and target. IOR occurred only when SOA was long and there was no temporal overlap between cue and target. Facilitation encompassed the cued location and all locations between the cue and fixation, whereas IOR arose for the entire cued hemifield. These findings suggest that the facilitation and IOR found on COVATs that use noninformative peripheral cues are separable and stimulus-driven processes."
658,Specialist registrars' emotional responses to a patient's death,A. Baverstock;F. Finlay,Archives of Disease in Childhood,Aim: To investigate the emotional reactions of registrars following the death of a child.Methods: A multicentre study to determine the sources of support for registrars and the use of debriefing following a child’s death. A questionnaire was sent or given to registrars within the South West Region.Results: There was a 75% response rate; 71% of registrars felt they had initial support but limited ongoing support and 69% of registrars supported junior colleagues. There was debriefing in 31% of cases.Conclusions: More accessible and constructive support for staff needs to be developed following a patient’s death.
659,Specific interactions between zinc metalloproteinase and its inhibitors: Ab initio fragment molecular orbital calculations,A. Ara;R. Kadoya;H. Ishimura;K. Shimamura;N. Kurita,Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling,"Bacteria secrete the enzyme pseudolysin (PLN) to degrade exocellular proteins, and the produced peptides are used as a nutrient for the bacteria. It is thus expected that inhibition of PLN can suppress bacterial growth. Since such inhibitors do not attack to bacteria directly, the risk of producing drug-resistance bacteria is less. However, endogenous proteinases such as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have active site similar to that of PLN, and there is a possibility that PLN inhibitors also inhibit the activity of MMPs, resulting in a loss of substrate degradation by these proteinases. Therefore, agents that inhibit the activity of only PLN and not MMPs are required. In the present study, we select two compounds (ARP101 and LM2) and investigate their specific interactions with PLN and MMPs by use of ab initio molecular simulations. Based on the results, we propose several novel compounds as candidates for potent PLN inhibition and investigate their binding properties with PLN, elucidating that the compound, in which a toluene group is introduced into LM2, has larger binding energy with PLN compared with the pristine LM2. Therefore, this compound is suggested to be a potent PLN inhibitor."
660,Specification problems with information content of earnings: revisions and rationality of expectations and self‐selection bias,A. Abdel‐Khalik,Contemporary Accounting Research,"This paper examines three possible specification problems with the research on information content of earnings disclosure. The first deals with the extent to which contemporaneous prediction errors are good surrogates for revisions of future earnings expectations and, hence, distributions of cash flows. This problem is elucidated by evaluating analysts' revisions of future earnings expectations as “relevant omitted variables.” The results show that the quality of such surrogation is high in the first quarter but low in the second. The second problem concerns the degree to which analysts' earnings forecasts are good surrogates for the market's own earnings expectations. Unbiasedness and orthogonality are the two properties examined. Although analysts' forecasts satisfy the unbiasedness property, the necessary condition of orthogonality is not satisfied. Hence, analysts' earnings forecasts are not Muthian rational expectations (i.e., they are not good surrogates for market forecasts). Consequently, the explanatory power of known empirical results is likely to be understated."
661,Spectral Dependence of the Internal Quantum Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells: Effect of Charge Generation Pathways,A. Armin;I. Kassal;P. Shaw;M. Hambsch;M. Stolterfoht;D. Lyons;J. Li;Z. Shi;P. Burn;P. Meredith,Journal of the American Chemical Society,"The conventional picture of photocurrent generation in organic solar cells involves photoexcitation of the electron donor, followed by electron transfer to the acceptor via an interfacial charge-transfer state (Channel I). It has been shown that the mirror-image process of acceptor photoexcitation leading to hole transfer to the donor is also an efficient means to generate photocurrent (Channel II). The donor and acceptor components may have overlapping or distinct absorption characteristics. Hence, different excitation wavelengths may preferentially activate one channel or the other, or indeed both. As such, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the solar cell may likewise depend on the excitation wavelength. We show that several model high-efficiency organic solar cell blends, notably PCDTBT:PC70BM and PCPDTBT:PC60/70BM, exhibit flat IQEs across the visible spectrum, suggesting that charge generation is occurring either via a dominant single channel or via both channels but with comparable efficiencies. In contrast, blends of the narrow optical gap copolymer DPP-DTT with PC70BM show two distinct spectrally flat regions in their IQEs, consistent with the two channels operating at different efficiencies. The observed energy dependence of the IQE can be successfully modeled as two parallel photodiodes, each with its own energetics and exciton dynamics but both having the same extraction efficiency. Hence, an excitation-energy dependence of the IQE in this case can be explained as the interplay between two photocurrent-generating channels, without recourse to hot excitons or other exotic processes."

The new ligands and their complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, ΛM, infrared, u.v.–vis, 1H- and 13C-n.m.r. spectroscopy, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The thermal properties of all complexes have been investigated by TG technique. The complexes contain two monoanionic, bidentate NO ligands. It was found that all the complexes are mononuclear. Antimicrobial activities of the ligands and their complexes have been tested against five different microorganisms, and some of the complexes were found to be active against some of the microorganisms studied."

Vittone,Optics Letters,"We present the results of variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry and transmittance measurements to determine the variation of the complex refractive index of ion-implanted single-crystal diamond. An increase is found in both real and imaginary parts at increasing damage densities. The index depth variation is determined in the whole wavelength range between 250 and 1690 nm. The dependence from the vacancy density is evaluated, highlighting a deviation from linearity in the high-damage-density regime. A considerable increase (up to 5%) in the real part of the index is observed, attributed to an increase in polarizability, thus offering new microfabrication possibilities for waveguides and other photonic structures in diamond."

Righini,Laser & Photonics Reviews,"Whispering‐gallery modes (WGM) on a spherical surface were first described by Lord Rayleigh at the beginning of the last century, but only after the invention of laser did they start to have some scientific relevance and only during the last two decades there has been a substantial move towards real devices and practical applications. WGM resonators have peculiar properties, the most notable being the potential of having an ultrahigh quality factor Q, which makes them very appealing both as laser cavities and as extremely sensitive sensors. Among the different types of WGM resonators, the microspherical ones represent a very important category, due to their simplicity, easy fabrication, and very high quality. In this review we provide a description of their fundamental properties and we summarize recent works on their application as filters, sensors and lasers."
665,Spill-over Effects of Affirmative Action: Political Representation and the Power of the Elderly,A. Baltrunaite;A. Casarico;P. Profeta,CESifo Working Papers,"There is evidence that age matters in politics. In this paper we study whether implementation of affirmative action policies on gender can generate additional effects on an alternative dimension of representation, namely, the age of politicians. We consider an Italian law which introduced gender quotas in candidate lists for local elections in 1993, and was abolished in 1995. As not all municipalities went through elections during this period, we can identify two groups of municipalities and use a Difference in differences estimation to analyze the effect of gender quotas on the age of elected politicians. We find that gender quotas are associated with election of politicians that are younger by more than one year. The effect occurs mainly due to the reduction in age of elected male politicians and is consistent with the optimizing behavior of parties or of voters."
666,Spin–orbit configuration interaction study of the ultraviolet photofragmentation of XeH+,A. Alekseyev;H. Liebermann;R. Buenker,Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,"The multireference spin–orbit CI method is employed to calculate potential energy curves for the ground and low-lying excited states of the XeH+ cation. For the first time, the spin–orbit interaction is taken into account and electric dipole moments are computed for transitions to the states responsible for the first absorption continuum (A band) of XeH+. On this basis, the partial and total absorption spectra in this energy range are obtained. It is found that the A-band absorption is dominated by the spin-forbidden parallel transition, while perpendicular transitions to the B1Π and b3Π1 states are significantly weaker. The Γ(ν) branching ratio defined as the ratio of the Xe+(2P1/2) yield to the total yield of the Xe+ cations from the XeH+ photodissociation is calculated for the (42–80) × 103 spectral range. It is shown that Γ(ν) increases smoothly from <0.2 in the red and blue tails of the band to its maximum of 0.92 in the middle of the band, at E ≃ 51.4 × 103 cm−1. The high Γ(ν) values correspond to the predominant formation of the spin-excited Xe+(2P1/2) ions that may be used to obtain IR laser generation at the Xe+(2P1/2 − 2P3/2) transition. The calculated XeH+ data are compared with those for the isovalent ArH+, KrH+, and HI systems."
667,Spitzer Space Telescope Spectroscopy of Ices toward Low-Mass Embedded Protostars*,A. Boogert;K. Pontoppidan;F. Lahuis;J. Jørgensen;J. Augereau;G. Blake;T. Brooke;J. Brown;C. Dullemond;N. Evans,"Astrophysical Journal, Supplement Series","Sensitive 5-38 μm Spitzer Space Telescope and ground-based 3-5 μm spectra of the embedded low-mass protostars B5 IRS1 and HH 46 IRS show deep ice absorption bands superposed on steeply rising mid-infrared continua. The ices likely originate in the circumstellar envelopes. The CO2 bending mode at 15 μm is a particularly powerful tracer of the ice composition and processing history. Toward these protostars, this band shows little evidence for thermal processing at temperatures above 50 K. Signatures of lower temperature processing are present in the CO and OCN- bands, however. The observed CO2 profile indicates an intimate mixture with H2O, but not necessarily with CH3OH, in contrast to some high-mass protostars. This is consistent with the low CH3OH abundance derived from the ground-based L-band spectra. The CO2 : H2O column density ratios are high in both B5 IRS1 and HH 46 IRS (~35%). Clearly, the Spitzer spectra are essential for studying ice evolution in low-mass protostellar environments and for eventually determining the relation between interstellar and solar system ices."
668,Spontaneous co-assembly of lactoferrin and β-lactoglobulin as a promising biocarrier for vitamin B9,A. Chapeau;G. Tavares;P. Hamon;T. Croguennec;S. Bouhallab,Food Hydrocolloids,"The design of biocarriers for protection and controlled delivery of bioactives represents a challenge for developing functional foods. We investigated the potentiality of heteroprotein Beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) and Lactoferrin (LF) co-assemblies as biocarriers for vitamin B9 (B9). Using different B9:protein mixing ratios, B9-LF-BLG co-assemblies were obtained and assessed by turbidity and phase contrast microscopy. Kinetics of their formation and stability were monitored. B9 entrapment efficiency was evaluated. Two types of B9-LF-BLG co-assembly were identified: aggregates (at low and high protein concentrations), and heteroprotein coacervates (at intermediate protein concentrations), both exhibiting different kinetics and stability over time. Compiling screening maps of B9-LF-BLG co-assemblies and B9 entrapments, we evidenced that B9-LF-BLG coacervates exhibited higher performance as B9 biocarrier, with an optimal entrapment of ≈10 mg B9/g protein. Therefore, such co-assembly displays useful potentialities as vitamin biocarriers for the design of natural functional foods, offering enhanced health benefits, yet without resorting to non-food additives."
669,Spreading of a Water Drop Triggered by the Surface Tension Gradient Created by the Localized Addition of a Surfactant,A. Chengara;A. Nikolov;D. Wasan,Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research,"The spreading of aqueous solutions of trisiloxane surfactants on solid surfaces has been studied extensively. Trisiloxane surfactants are used in pesticide delivery as adjuvants to promote spreading on leaves and provide a larger area for solute transfer. The spreading of a dew-drop on a leaf when a spray of pesticide is delivered is simulated by studying the spreading of a water drop on a hydrophobic surface when a small drop of aqueous trisiloxane surfactant is brought in contact with it. This study reveals many new features that differ from the spreading of an aqueous trisiloxane drop on a solid surface; the spreading of the substrate drop is characterized by an inertial rather than a viscous response, the imposed surface tension gradient dies out rapidly, and the spreading velocity is consistent with a balance of kinetic energy imparted to the substrate drop and the decrease in its surface energy."
670,Stability of Affine G-varieties and Irreducibility in Reductive Groups,A. Casimiro;C. Florentino,ArXiv Mathematics,"Let $G$ be a reductive affine algebraic group, and let $X$ be an affine algebraic $G$-variety. We establish a (poly)stability criterion for points $x\in X$ in terms of intrinsically defined closed subgroups $H_{x}$ of $G$, and relate it with the numerical criterion of Mumford, and with Richardson and Bate-Martin-R\""ohrle criteria, in the case $X=G^{N}$. Our criterion builds on a close analogue of a theorem of Mundet and Schmitt on polystability and allows the generalization to the algebraic group setting of results of Johnson-Millson and Sikora about complex representation varieties of finitely presented groups. By well established results, it also provides a restatement of the non-abelian Hodge theorem in terms of stability notions."
671,Stabilization of the Trigonal High-Temperature Phase of Formamidinium Lead Iodide,A. Binek;F. Hanusch;P. Docampo;T. Bein,Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters,"Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) has the potential to achieve higher performance than established perovskite solar cells like methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), while maintaining a higher stability. The major drawback for the latter material is that it can crystallize at room temperature in a wide bandgap hexagonal symmetry (P63mc) instead of the desired trigonal (P3m1) black phase formed at a higher temperature (130 °C). Our results show that employing a mixture of MAI and FAI in films deposited via a two-step approach, where the MAI content is <20%, results in the exchange of FA molecules with MA without any significant lattice shrinkage. Additionally, we show with temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction that the trigonal phase exhibits no phase changes in the temperature range studied (25 to 250 °C). We attribute the stabilization of the structure to stronger interactions between the MA cation and the inorganic cage. Finally, we show that the inclusion of this small amount of MA also has a positive effect on the lifetime of the photoexcited species and results in more efficient devices."
672,"Staff Member Reactions to Same-Gender, Resident-to-Resident Sexual Behavior Within Long-Term Care Facilities",A. Ahrendt;E. Sprankle;A. Kuka;K. Mcpherson,Journal of Homosexuality,"The current study assesses ageism and heterosexism relating to older adult sexual activity within long-term care facilities. To assess caregiver reactions, 153 residential care facility staff members read one of three vignettes. Each vignette described a scenario in which a staff member walks in on two residents (male/female, male/male, or female/female) engaging in sexual activity. Although no main effects were discovered for vignette type, exploratory analyses revealed that the facility where participants were employed was significantly related to their ratings of approval. Furthermore, an interaction effect between vignette and facility types was also discovered for caregivers’ approval of sexual activity among residents. Additionally, a strong overall approval rating of older adult sexuality was reported by staff members. The results of this study warrant that further research is necessary regarding older adults’ perception of caregiver bias, as well as further investigation of caregivers’ perceptions of older adults’ sexual activity."
673,"Stark fluorescence spectroscopy on peridinin–chlorophyll–protein complex of dinoflagellate, Amphidinium carterae",A. Ara;M. Kashem;R. Grondelle;M. Wahadoszamen,Photosynthesis Research,"Because of their peculiar but intriguing photophysical properties, peridinin–chlorophyll–protein complexes (PCPs), the peripheral light-harvesting antenna complexes of photosynthetic dinoflagellates have been unique targets of multidimensional theoretical and experimental investigations over the last few decades. The major light-harvesting chlorophyll a (Chl a) pigments of PCP are hypothesized to be spectroscopically heterogeneous. To study the spectral heterogeneity in terms of electrostatic parameters, we, in this study, implemented Stark fluorescence spectroscopy on PCP isolated from the dinoflagellate Amphidinium carterae. The comprehensive theoretical modeling of the Stark fluorescence spectrum with the help of the conventional Liptay formalism revealed the simultaneous presence of three emission bands in the fluorescence spectrum of PCP recorded upon excitation of peridinin. The three emission bands are found to possess different sets of electrostatic parameters with essentially increasing magnitude of charge-transfer character from the blue to redder ones. The different magnitudes of electrostatic parameters give good support to the earlier proposition that the spectral heterogeneity in PCP results from emissive Chl a clusters anchored at a different sites and domains within the protein network."
674,Statistical procedures for determining the extent of cognitive change following concussion,A. Collie;P. Maruff;M. Makdissi;M. Mcstephen;D. Darby;P. Mccrory,British Journal of Sports Medicine,"Neuropsychological (NP) testing is now often used to help to determine if the cognitive function of a concussed athlete has declined. The NP test score after concussion is compared with the baseline test score. Many clinicians simply subtract one from the other and make a clinical decision about the significance or otherwise of the resulting “difference score”. Such techniques are inadequate, as they fail to account for the many factors that may confound interpretation of serially acquired cognitive test scores. This is a review of a number of alternative approaches used in other areas of medicine for differentiating “true” changes from changes caused by these confounding factors. A case example is used to illustrate the effect that the statistical approach may have on clinical decision making."
675,Statistically robust 2-D visual servoing,A. Comport;E. Marchand;F. Chaumette,IEEE Transactions on Robotics,"A fundamental step toward broadening the use of real-world image-based visual servoing is to deal with the important issue of reliability and robustness. In order to address this issue, a closed-loop control law is proposed that simultaneously accomplishes a visual servoing task and is robust to a general class of image processing errors. This is achieved with the application of widely accepted statistical techniques such as robust M-estimation and LMedS. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate visual servoing tasks that resist severe outlier contamination."
676,Steady-State and Small-Signal Analysis of A-Source Converter,A. Ayachit;Y. Siwakoti;V. Galigekere;M. Kazimierczuk;F. Blaabjerg,IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics,"This paper presents a detailed steady-state analysis and ac small-signal modeling of the power stage of pulse-width modulated A-source converter. The voltage and current waveforms along with their corresponding expressions describing the converter operation are presented in detail. The input-to-output and input-to-capacitor dc voltage transfer functions are determined. The minimum inductance required to ensure continuous conduction mode is derived. The expressions for the semiconductor devices stresses are also presented. The dc, averaged equivalent circuit is derived using the circuit averaging technique. A complete derivation of the small-signal model including the converter parasitic resistances are presented followed by the power stage transfer functions relevant to the capacitor voltage loop, such as: 1) duty cycle-to-capacitor voltage; and 2) input-to-capacitor voltage. In addition, the expressions for the network input impedance and output impedance are derived. Finally, experimental validations of the derived small-signal models are performed, both in frequency and time domain for a laboratory prototype of an A-source converter. The theoretical predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results over a wide range of frequencies."
677,Steam batch thermal processes in unsteady state conditions: Modelling and application to a case study in the food industry,A. Biglia;L. Comba;E. Fabrizio;P. Gay;D. Aimonino,Applied Thermal Engineering,"Many industrial processes require high amounts of steam. Design and operation of steam plants are particularly complex when the steam supply is required for short periods and with a varying time schedules. To fulfil the discontinuous needs of steam users, avoiding the steam boiler oversizing to the peak value of the steam request, a thermal energy storage (TES) system can be adopted. The proper sizing of TES systems, which, in this application, is constituted by a steam accumulator vessel installed between the steam generator and the consumer, cannot be based on the sole initial and final state conditions of the steam storage, since a performance prediction of the process time-evolution is also required.In this paper, a model of steam batch processes for industrial thermal treatments, able to describe unsteady operative conditions, is presented. More in detail, a three-stage steam plant, with a sequentially interconnected steam boiler, steam accumulator and processing tank, has been considered. The dynamic model of the charging and discharging processes of the steam accumulator has been applied to a real case study in the food industry: the batch debacterisation process of cocoa beans. Nevertheless, the obtained results can be profitably employed in the design and the performance assessments of a wide set of applications involving the steam processing fluid, such as desalination plants, solar thermal power plants, retorts, steam ovens and others."
678,Stigmergy-based modeling to discover urban activity patterns from positioning data,A. Alfeo;M. Cimino;S. Egidi;B. Lepri;A. Pentland;G. Vaglini,ArXiv Physics,"Positioning data offer a remarkable source of information to analyze crowdsurban dynamics. However, discovering urban activity patterns from the emergentbehavior of crowds involves complex system modeling. An alternative approach isto adopt computational techniques belonging to the emergent paradigm, whichenables self-organization of data and allows adaptive analysis. Specifically,our approach is based on stigmergy. By using stigmergy each sample position isassociated with a digital pheromone deposit, which progressively evaporates andaggregates with other deposits according to their spatiotemporal proximity.Based on this principle, we exploit positioning data to identify high densityareas (hotspots) and characterize their activity over time. Thischaracterization allows the comparison of dynamics occurring in different days,providing a similarity measure exploitable by clustering techniques. Thus, wecluster days according to their activity behavior, discovering unexpected urbanactivity patterns. As a case study, we analyze taxi traces in New York Cityduring 2015."
679,Stochastic modeling of direct radiation transmission in particle-laden turbulent flow,A. Banko;L. Villafañe;J. Kim;M. Esmaily;J. Eaton,Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer,"Direct radiation transmission in turbulent flows laden with heavy particles plays a fundamental role in systems such as clouds and particle solar receivers. Owing to their inertia, particles are preferentially concentrated by the turbulence, and the resulting voids and clusters lead to deviations in mean transmission from the classical Beer-Lambert law for exponential extinction. Additionally, the transmission fluctuations can exceed those of Poissonian media by an order of magnitude, which implies a gross misprediction in transmission statistics if the correlations in particle positions are neglected. On the other hand, tracking millions of particles in a turbulence simulation can be prohibitively expensive. We propose stochastic processes as computationally inexpensive reduced order models for the instantaneous particle number density field and radiation transmission therein. Results from the stochastic processes are compared to Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MCRT) simulations using the particle positions obtained from the point-particle direct numerical simulation (DNS) of isotropic turbulence at a Taylor Reynolds number of 150. Accurate transmission statistics are predicted with respect to MCRT by matching the mean, variance, and correlation length of the DNS number density fields. Formulation of the stochastic processes in terms of stochastic differential equations allows an exact solution for arbitrary moments of radiation transmission to be derived from the Kolmogorov backwards equations. Higher order statistics such as the transmission variance, and correlations between particle number density, transmission, and absorption are compared to MCRT and discussed."
680,Stopping cross-section measurements of 4He in TiN1.1O0.27,A. Climent-Font;K. Väkeväinen;J. Räisänen;E. Rauhala,"Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research, Section B: Beam Interactions with Materials and Atoms",The stopping cross-section for 4He projectiles in TiNx compounds has been measured using the backscattering method. A multi-compound marker layer deposited between the test film and the substrate was used to obtain the stopping cross-section at several energies with one energy of the incident beam. Two RBS spectra at definite tilt angles of the sample are taken for each beam energy. The assistance of computer codes to synthesize RBS spectra is very useful to obtain the pertinent information from the displacements of the peaks of the marker layers. Stopping cross-section values are obtained with an estimated uncertainty of about 6%.

682,Structural Characterization of a Model Gram-Negative Bacterial Surface Using Lipopolysaccharides from Rough Strains of Escherichia coli,A. Brun;L. Clifton;C. Halbert;B. Lin;M. Meron;P. Holden;J. Lakey;S. Holt,Biomacromolecules,"Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) make up approximately 75% of the Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane (OM) surface, but because of the complexity of the molecule, there are very few model OMs that include LPS. The LPS molecule consists of lipid A, which anchors the LPS within the OM, a core polysaccharide region, and a variable O-antigen polysaccharide chain. In this work we used RcLPS (consisting of lipid A plus the first seven sugars of the core polysaccharide) from a rough strain of Escherichia coli to form stable monolayers of LPS at the air–liquid interface. The vertical structure RcLPS monolayers were characterized using neutron and X-ray reflectometry, while the lateral structure was investigated using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and Brewster angle microscopy. It was found that RcLPS monolayers at surface pressures of 20 mN m–1 and above are resolved as hydrocarbon tails, an inner headgroup, and an outer headgroup of polysaccharide with increasing solvation from tails to outer headgroups. The lateral organization of the hydrocarbon lipid chains displays an oblique hexagonal unit cell at all surface pressures, with only the chain tilt angle changing with surface pressure. This is in contrast to lipid A, which displays hexagonal or, above 20 mN m–1, distorted hexagonal packing. This work provides the first complete structural analysis of a realistic E. coli OM surface model."
683,Structural Insights into the Molecular Mechanism of Vitamin D Receptor Activation by Lithocholic Acid Involving a New Mode of Ligand Recognition,A. Belorusova;J. Eberhardt;N. Potier;R. Stote;A. Dejaegere;N. Rochel,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,"The vitamin D receptor (VDR), an endocrine nuclear receptor for 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, acts also as a bile acid sensor by binding lithocholic acid (LCA). The crystal structure of the zebrafish VDR ligand binding domain in complex with LCA and the SRC-2 coactivator peptide reveals the binding of two LCA molecules by VDR. One LCA binds to the canonical ligand-binding pocket, and the second one, which is not fully buried, is anchored to a site located on the VDR surface. Despite the low affinity of the alternative site, the binding of the second molecule promotes stabilization of the active receptor conformation. Biological activity assays, structural analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the recognition of two ligand molecules is crucial for VDR agonism by LCA. The unique binding mode of LCA provides clues for the development of new chemical compounds that target alternative binding sites for therapeutic applications."
684,Structural Requirements for the Substrates of the H+/Peptide Cotransporter PEPT2 Determined by Three-Dimensional Quantitative Structure−Activity Relationship Analysis,A. Biegel;S. Gebauer;M. Brandsch;K. Neubert;I. Thondorf,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,"The renal type H+/peptide cotransporter PEPT2 has a substantial influence on the in vivo disposition of dipeptides and tripeptides as well as peptide-like drugs within the body, particularly in kidney, lung, and the brain. The comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) method was applied to identify those regions in the substrate structures that are responsible for recognition and for differences in affinity. We have developed a comprehensive 3D quantitative structure−activity relationship (3D-QSAR) model based on 83 compounds that is able to explain and predict the binding affinities of new PEPT2 substrates. This 3D-QSAR model possesses a high predictive power (q2 = 0.755; r2 = 0.893). An additional 3D-QSAR model based on the same compounds was generated and correlated with affinity data of the intestinal H+/peptide cotransporter PEPT1. By comparing the CoMSIA contour plots, differences in selectivity between the intestinal and the renal type peptide carrier become evident."
685,"Structural analysis and biological activities of BXL0124, a gemini analog of vitamin D",A. Belorusova;N. Suh;H. Lee;J. So;N. Rochel,Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,"Gemini analogs of calcitriol, characterized by the extension of the C21-methyl group of calcitriol with a second chain, act as agonists of the vitamin D receptor (VDR). This second side chain of gemini is accommodated in a new cavity inside the VDR created by the structural rearrangement of the protein core. The resulting conformational change preserves the active state of the receptor and bestows gemini compounds with biological activities that exceed those of calcitriol. Of particular interest are gemini’s anti-cancer properties, and in this study we demonstrate anti-proliferative and tumor-reducing abilities of BXL0124 and BXL0097, differing only by the presence or absence, respectively, of the methylene group on the A ring. BXL0124 acts as a more potent VDR agonist than its 19-nor counterpart by activating VDR-mediated transcription at lower concentrations. In a similar manner, BXL0124 is more active than BXL0097 in growth inhibition of breast cancer cells and reduction of tumor volume. Structural comparisons of BXL0097 and BXL0124, as their VDR complexes, explain the elevated activity of the latter."
686,Structural analysis identifies an escape route from the adverse lipogenic effects of liver X receptor ligands,A. Belorusova;E. Evertsson;D. Hovdal;J. Sandmark;E. Bratt;I. Maxvall;I. Schulman;P. Åkerblad;E. Lindstedt,Communications Biology,"Liver X receptors (LXRs) are attractive drug targets for cardiovascular disease treatment due to their role in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and immunity. The anti-atherogenic properties of LXRs have prompted development of synthetic ligands, but these cause major adverse effects—such as increased lipogenesis—which are challenging to dissect from their beneficial activities. Here we show that LXR compounds displaying diverse functional responses in animal models induce distinct receptor conformations. Combination of hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and multivariate analysis allowed identification of LXR regions differentially correlating with anti-atherogenic and lipogenic activities of ligands. We show that lipogenic compounds stabilize active states of LXRα and LXRβ while the anti-atherogenic expression of the cholesterol transporter ABCA1 is associated with the ligand-induced stabilization of LXRα helix 3. Our data indicates that avoiding ligand interaction with the activation helix 12 while engaging helix 3 may provide directions for development of ligands with improved therapeutic profiles."
687,Structural and Topographic Aspects of Degenerative Dementia: Diagnostic Considerations,A. Brun,International Psychogeriatrics,"A thorough neuropathological analysis of several hundred cases from a prospective dementia study shows degenerative disorders such as dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) and frontal lobe dementia (FLD) of non-Alzheimer type to be the prevailing disorders.The pattern of basic changes relatable to neuronal atrophy in DAT correlates better to functional parameters and symptomatology than do senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangle density and distribution. The etiological or pathogenetic role of amyloid and of a cholinergic deficit also remains unclear. The dominating disease pattern may be blurred by confounding additional alterations with more pronounced frontal case pathology, as found in a limited number of cases. Another and much more common factor is structural white matter attenuation associated with cerebrovascular pathology as well as frank infarctions in a smaller but still important number of DAT cases. The concurrence of degenerative and other brain changes each at subthreshold levels may cause signs and symptoms of a dementia difficult to classify.Frontal lobe dementia of non-Alzheimer type, the next most common dementing degenerative disorder, displays only the basic changes found in DAT but derives its separate clinical profile from the frontal predominance of lesions. It may be confounded with Pick's disease and others possibly belonging to the same group, but also with frontally projected dementias due to lesions ranging from thalamic infarcts to brain stem afflictions.The topographic pattern of lesions rather than the structural details forms a useful basis for a clinical classification of the dementing disorders."

The oxidation of the Sn film was carried out at 600, 700 and 900 °C for 2 h in a controlled oxygen atmosphere. GIXRD confirmed the tetragonal rutile phase of SnO2 which was further confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The RBS measurements provided the thickness and chemical information of the film. Thickness of the film was in the range of 6⿿12 nm and the presence of Sn and oxygen in the films are shown. Scanning electron microscopy revealed spherical particles of different sizes for films annealed at different temperatures. The SnO2 thin film oxidized at 900 °C was tested for methane gas sensing.

689,"Structure Elucidation, Synthesis, and Contact Allergenic Activity of a Major Hydroperoxide Formed at Autoxidation of the Ethoxylated Surfactant C12E5",A. Bodin;M. Linnerborg;J. Nilsson;A. Karlberg,Chemical Research in Toxicology,"Ethoxylated alcohols, widely used as surfactants, are known to be susceptible to oxidation when exposed to air. At autoxidation, a complex mixture is formed, in which alkyl poly(ethylene glycol) aldehydes, alkyl poly(ethylene glycol) formates, hydroxyaldehydes, and formaldehyde have previously been identified. These compounds are all secondary oxidation products, some of which have been shown to be skin sensitizers and irritants. The primary oxidation products from ethoxylated alcohols are described in the literature as peroxides and hydroperoxides, but their structures have not been elucidated more closely. Peroxides and hydroperoxides are usually reactive species and can be suspected to be biologically active as skin sensitizers and irritants. In the present investigation, we studied the autoxidation of the pure ethoxylated alcohol pentaethylene glycol mono-n-dodecyl ether (C12E5), using NMR and HPLC-MS. On the basis of experience from previous studies on a small model compound, diethyleneglycol monoethyl ether (C2E2), the hydroperoxide expected to be found in the highest amount in autoxidized C12E5 was synthesized and used as a reference substance in the analyses. This same hydroperoxide, 16-hydroperoxy-3,6,9,12,15-pentaoxaheptacosan-1-ol, was identified in the autoxidation mixture of C12E5, and its sensitizing capacity was determined. It was found to be a moderate allergen in experimental sensitization studies in guinea pigs. Our data further indicate the presence of at least three additional hydroperoxides in the autoxidation mixture of C12E5, one of which was identified as 1-hydroperoxy-3,6,9,12,15-pentaoxaheptacosan-1-ol. The results accentuate the importance of controlling the storage, transportation, and handling conditions of ethoxylated surfactants, to avoid the formation of allergenic and skin irritant oxidation products."
690,Structure and Analysis of a Complex between SUMO and Ubc9 Illustrates Features of a Conserved E2-Ubl Interaction,A. Capili;C. Lima,Journal of Molecular Biology,"The SUMO E2 Ubc9 serves as a lynchpin in the SUMO conjugation pathway, interacting with the SUMO E1 during activation, with thioester linked SUMO after E1 transfer and with the substrate and SUMO E3 ligases during conjugation. Here, we describe the structure determination of a non-covalent complex between human Ubc9 and SUMO-1 at 2.4 Å resolution. Non-covalent interactions between Ubc9 and SUMO are conserved in human and yeast insomuch as human Ubc9 interacts with each of the human SUMO isoforms, and yeast Ubc9 interacts with Smt3, the yeast SUMO ortholog. Structural comparisons reveal similarities to several other non-covalent complexes in the ubiquitin pathway, suggesting that the non-covalent Ubc9–SUMO interface may be important for poly-SUMO chain formation, for E2 recruitment to SUMO conjugated substrates, or for mediating E2 interactions with either E1 or E3 ligases. Biochemical analysis suggests that this surface is less important for E1 activation or di-SUMO-2 formation, but more important for E3 interactions and for poly-SUMO chain formation when the chain exceeds more than two SUMO proteins."
691,Structure of the C-terminal RING Finger from a RING-IBR-RING/TRIAD Motif Reveals a Novel Zinc-binding Domain Distinct from a RING,A. Capili;E. Edghill;K. Wu;K. Borden,Journal of Molecular Biology,"The really interesting new gene (RING) family of proteins contains over 400 members with diverse physiological functions. A subset of these domains is found in the context of the RING-IBR-RING/TRIAD motifs which function as E3 ubiquitin ligases. Our sequence analysis of the C-terminal RING (RING2) from this motif show that several metal ligating and hydrophobic residues critical for the formation of a classical RING cross-brace structure are not present. Thus, we determined the structure of the RING2 from the RING-IBR-RING motif of HHARI and showed that RING2 has a completely distinct topology from classical RINGs. Notably, RING2 binds only one zinc atom per monomer rather than two and uses a different hydrophobic network to that of classical RINGs. Additionally, this RING2 topology is novel, bearing slight resemblance to zinc-ribbon motifs around the zinc site and is different from the topologies of the zinc binding sites found in RING and PHDs. We demonstrate that RING2 acts as an E3 ligase in vitro and using mutational analysis deduce the structural features required for this activity. Further, mutations in the RING-IBR-RING of Parkin cause a rare form of Parkinsonism and these studies provide an explanation for those mutations that occur in its RING2. From a comparison of the RING2 structure with those reported for RINGs, we infer sequence determinants that allow discrimination between RING2 and RING domains at the sequence analysis level.The really interesting new gene (RING) family of proteins contains over 400 members with diverse physiological functions.

Camuffo,Energy and Buildings,"A multidisciplinary approach was used to study the reason behind the deterioration of four stucco panels that decorate the vault of Room VI in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. During the last nine years the panels were subjected twice to restoration because some cracks, which appeared over the surface of the reliefs jeopardizing the integrity of the gladiators.Since the deterioration continued diagnostic investigations of the components of the stucco panels were performed to analyze both the elements and compounds, and the mineralogical structure. A microclimate study was conducted to assess the impact of the indoor environment on the panels. Measurements and statistical analysis of the data were performed in accordance with the European Standards EN 15757:2010, EN 15758:2010, and EN 16242:2012.It was concluded that the deterioration is related to high temperatures in a dry environment exacerbated by artificial lighting with incandescent lamps, located in the proximity of the panels and continuously on for 12 h daily. The body heat released by numerous visitors on a daily basis is an additional problem which should not be overlooked."
693,Studies on electrochemical deposition and physicochemical properties of nanocrystalline Ni‐Mo alloys,A. Bigos;E. Beltowska-Lehman;M. Kot,Surface and Coatings Technology,"Nanocystalline Ni‐Mo coatings were deposited from citrate-ammonia solution, in a model system with a rotating disc electrode (RDE) using low carbon steel discs as the cathode. The effect of parameters such as electrolyte solution pH (from 4 to 10), temperature (from 20 °C to 60 °C), and hydrodynamic conditions (RDE speed in the range of 0 to 640 rpm) on chemical and phase composition, microstructure, average crystallite size of coatings and current efficiency of electrodeposition was investigated. It was confirmed that, in the induced co-deposition process, molybdenum acts as a grain refinement modifier. This, apart from influencing changes in surface morphology, has a significant effect on the mechanical properties of the layers. For alloys containing less than 16 wt% of Mo (related to the crystallite size of 7 nm) loss of strengthening effect (the inverse Hall-Petch relationship) was observed, which was correlated with the decrease in coatings' resistance to wear. Hence, for electrodeposition nanocrystalline Ni‐Mo alloys characterised by high microhardness, good resistance to wear and adhesion to the steel substrate, the suitable conditions for electrolysis were determined. These conditions include: electrolyte solution pH above 7, plating temperature in the range of 20 °C to 40 °C, and hydrodynamic conditions corresponding to the RDE speed of 260 to 640 rpm.Plating conditions for obtaining superior nanocrystalline Ni‐Mo coatings were developed.Effect of electrodeposition parameters on Ni‐Mo composition and properties was studied.Molybdenum acts as a modifier reducing the grain size of Ni‐Mo alloys from 50 to 2 nm.The resulting Ni‐Mo coatings are characterised by high hardness and good wear resistance.For alloys of Mo content exceeding 16 wt% the inverse Hall-Petch relation is observed.Nanocystalline Ni‐Mo coatings were deposited from citrate-ammonia solution, in a model system with a rotating disc electrode (RDE) using low carbon steel discs as the cathode.

Azzopardi,International Journal of Multiphase Flow,"The flow of a liquid film sheared by high velocity gas stream in a horizontal rectangular duct was investigated using a high-speed laser-induced fluorescence technique. Measurements of local film thickness were resolved in both longitudinal and transverse coordinates with high spatial and temporal resolution. It was found that the generation of fast and slow ripples by the disturbance waves was qualitatively the same as it was observed earlier in completely different conditions. The transverse size and curvature of the disturbance waves and ripples were measured. A relationship between the three-dimensional structure of ripples on top of disturbance waves and the two mechanisms of liquid entrainment, known as ‘bag break-up’ and ‘ligament break-up’, is proposed."

Montero,Construction and Building Materials,"This paper studies the effect of corrosion on the mechanical performance of steel embedded in reinforced concrete when different bar lengths are corroded. On seventy-two corrugated steel bars B500SD (with high ductility properties) that had been previously subjected to an accelerated corrosion process, corrosion was located in three different bar lengths that were tested to tensile strength. The influence of corrosion on the mechanical properties of the steel was assessed considering them individually and in relation to the concept of equivalent steel. The results obtained show that (i) significant variations are produced in the stress-strain curve obtained in tensile strength tests, even with corrosion degrees below 1%; (ii) the use of the equivalent steel concept is advantageous; (iii) the length of the corroded rod influences the value of the properties analyzed and their evolution.Different bar lengths are corroded and tested to tensile strength.The length of a corroded rod is a determining factor for all the parameters studied.The slope of tendency lines increases as the corroded bar length increases.The use of ductility criteria based on the concept of equivalent steel is appropriate.The values of ductility are greater with smaller corroded rod lengths.This paper studies the effect of corrosion on the mechanical performance of steel embedded in reinforced concrete when different bar lengths are corroded.

The 1,5-cyclooctadiene ligand is displaced by carbon monoxide to generate [Rh(CO)2(L1)][BF4] ([2][BF4]) in which in the solid state, the ligand L1 adopts a facial κ3N,N,O bonding mode.

697,Study of the impacts of droplets deposited from the gas core onto a gas-sheared liquid film,A. Cherdantsev;D. Hann;B. Hewakandamby;B. Azzopardi,International Journal of Multiphase Flow,"The results of an experimental study on droplet impactions in the flow of a gas-sheared liquid film are presented. In contrast to most similar studies, the impacting droplets were entrained from film surface by the gas stream. The measurements provide film thickness data, resolved in both longitudinal and transverse coordinates and in time together with the images of droplets above the interface and images of gas bubbles entrapped by liquid film. The parameters of impacting droplets were measured together with the local liquid film thickness. Two main scenarios of droplet-film interaction, based on type of film perturbation, are identified; the parameter identifying which scenario occurs is identified as the angle of impingement. At large angles an asymmetric crater appears on film surface; at shallow angles a long, narrow furrow appears. The most significant difference between the two scenarios is related to possible impact outcome: craters may lead to creation secondary droplets, whereas furrows are accompanied by entrapment of gas bubbles into the liquid film. In addition, occurrence of partial survival of impacting droplet is reported."
698,Study of the neural basis of striatal modulation of the jaw-opening reflex,A. Barceló;B. Fillipini;J. Pazo,Journal of Neural Transmission,"Previous experimental data from this laboratory demonstrated the participation of the striatum and dopaminergic pathways in central nociceptive processing. The objective of this study was to examine the possible pathways and neural structures associated with the analgesic action of the striatum. The experiments were carried out in rats anesthetized with urethane. The jaw-opening reflex (JOR) was evoked by electrical stimulation of the tooth pulp of lower incisors and recorded in the anterior belly of the digastric muscles. Intrastriatal microinjection of apomorphine, a nonspecific dopamine agonist, reduced or abolished the JOR amplitude. Electrolytic or kainic acid lesions, unilateral to the apomorphine-injected striatum, of the globus pallidus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, subthalamic nucleus and bilateral lesion the rostroventromedial medulla (RVM), blocked the inhibition of the JOR by striatal stimulation. These findings suggest that the main output nuclei of the striatum and the RVM may be critical elements in the neural pathways mediating the inhibition of the reflex response, evoked in jaw muscles by noxious stimulation of dental pulp."
699,"Study of the rust penetration and circumferential stresses in reinforced concrete at early stages of an accelerated corrosion test by means of combined SEM, EDS and strain gauges",A. Bazán;J. Gálvez;E. Reyes;D. Galé-Lamuela,Construction and Building Materials,"Corrosion of steel bars for reinforcement leads to expansive pressure on the surrounding concrete that causes internal cracking and, eventually, spalling and delamination. The numerical and analytical modelling of cover cracking due to the corrosion of concrete usually involves a delay in such corrosion as a consequence of accepting a propagation time, after the beginning of the process, in which rust products penetrate the porous network of the concrete and pressure is mitigated. However, the assessment of this delay is based on empirical data. Regarding such a time, there is limited published research that focuses on the initial stage of the propagation of rust products in the porous structure of the surrounding concrete.This work offers a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and strain gauges to study the phenomena involved at the beginning of corrosion. It focuses on the analysis of penetration of rust products into pores and measurement of strain and stresses caused in the concrete, near to the rebars, at the beginning of corrosion. It also involves use of an analytical model to calculate the width of the crack that could be used to estimate the time of cracking. The method has been applied to two concretes with a different porous network and with two distinct corrosion current densities to examine how the technique could monitor the reinforcement corrosion process and detect cracking of the surrounding concrete. The experimental work was performed by using an accelerated corrosion test on a conventional concrete (CC) and a concrete with silica fume (SFC) by submitting them, respectively, to a current density of 50 μA/cm2 and 100 μA/cm2. Part of the concrete specimens had embedded strain gauges, placed as closely as possible to the rebar, used to monitor the strain. The penetration of the rust layer was observed and measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). A good relationship between the velocity of the penetration of the rust products in the porous network and the delay of the cracking pressure in concrete was observed by introducing a reduction factor."
700,Stueckelberg massive electromagnetism in curved spacetime: Hadamard renormalization of the stress-energy tensor and the Casimir effect,A. Belokogne;A. Folacci,Physical Review D,"We discuss Stueckelberg massive electromagnetism on an arbitrary four-dimensional curved spacetime and, in particular, (i) the gauge invariance of the classical theory and its covariant quantization; (ii) the wave equations for the massive spin-1 field Aμ, for the auxiliary Stueckelberg scalar field Φ and for the ghost fields C and C*; (iii) Ward identities; (iv) the Hadamard representation of the various Feynman propagators and the covariant Taylor series expansions of the corresponding coefficients. This permits us to construct, for a Hadamard quantum state, the expectation value of the renormalized stress-energy tensor associated with the Stueckelberg theory. We provide two alternative but equivalent expressions for this result. The first one is obtained by removing the contribution of the “Stueckelberg ghost” Φ and only involves state-dependent and geometrical quantities associated with the massive vector field Aμ. The other one involves contributions coming from both the massive vector field and the auxiliary Stueckelberg scalar field, and it has been constructed in such a way that, in the zero-mass limit, the massive vector field contribution reduces smoothly to the result obtained from Maxwell’s theory. As an application of our results, we consider the Casimir effect outside a perfectly conducting medium with a plane boundary. We discuss the results obtained using Stueckelberg but also de Broglie-Proca electromagnetism, and we consider the zero-mass limit of the vacuum energy in both theories. We finally compare the de Broglie-Proca and Stueckelberg formalisms and highlight the advantages of the Stueckelberg point of view, even if, in our opinion, the de Broglie-Proca and Stueckelberg approaches of massive electromagnetism are two faces of the same field theory."
701,Stueckelberg massive electromagnetism in de Sitter and anti–de Sitter spacetimes: Two-point functions and renormalized stress-energy tensors,A. Belokogne;A. Folacci;J. Queva,Physical Review D,"By considering Hadamard vacuum states, we first construct the two-point functions associated with Stueckelberg massive electromagnetism in de Sitter and anti–de Sitter spacetimes. Then, from the general formalism developed by Belokogne and Folacci [Phys. Rev. D 93, 044063 (2016)], we obtain an exact analytical expression for the vacuum expectation value of the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the massive vector field propagating in these maximally symmetric spacetimes."
702,Subjective financial literacy and retail investors’ behavior,A. Bellofatto;C. D'Hondt;R. Winne,Journal of Banking and Finance,"This paper investigates the relationship between subjective financial literacy, i.e. self-reported by investors, and trading behavior. In particular, we use the level of financial knowledge and experience reported in the MiFID tests by retail investors. Such tests are implemented in the EU from the so-called Markets in Financial Instruments Directive since November 2007. We show that subjective financial literacy helps explain cross-sectional variations in retail investors’ behavior. Investors who report higher levels of financial literacy seem to invest smarter, even after controlling for gender, age, portfolio value, trading experience and education. They trade more and are less prone to the disposition effect. They tend to concentrate their portfolios on a small set of stocks and achieve diversification through investment funds holding. Their trading behaviors allow them to display higher gross and net returns as well as higher excess Sharpe ratios. Our findings are relevant for both policy making and understanding retail investors’ behavior."
703,Subjective processes of sexuality and citizenship in Mexico: Gender and the authorization of desire,A. Amuchástegui,Sexuality Research and Social Policy,"For the last 20 years, Mexican society has undergone an intense process of democratization, resulting in the growth of a sense of political, social, and even cultural citizenship. Whereas the promotion, protection, and fulfillment of political rights enjoy the endorsement of practically all social groups and institutions, notions of rights related to bodies and their pleasures—what might be called sexual citizenship— are still a matter for intense debate and political struggle. Drawing from a body of research on the social construction of sexuality in different parts of Mexico, this article explores cultural and social practices related to the authorization of sexual desires and pleasures—practices that contribute to a sense of sexual citizenship. The author argues that such subjective processes of authorization of sexual desire are marked and made difficult by heteronormative institutions—such as conjugal duty and notions of male sexuality—as experienced by particular men and women."
704,"Success through Failure: Translation, Temporal Tricks, and Numeric Concept‐Work",A. Ballestero,American Anthropologist,"In The Seductions of Quantification, Sally E. Merry provides a most welcome study of how international organizations “use of numbers to describe social phenomena in countable and commensurable terms” (p. 1). She centers on the use of indicators, a subset of numbers designed to provide precise meaning to complex social processes. Indicators aim to bound the meaning of such processes, to prescribe the ways we understand them, and to narrow the options we see as appropriate ways to intervene in them. Their purpose is to naturalize the scope of a social phenomenon as a measured and measurable concept so that comparisons in time and comparisons across cases can be made. Merry's book centers on how these indicators are made in three areas: human trafficking, violence against women, and human rights. Using a “genealogical method,” the book traces the decisions, hesitations, exclusions, and translations that lead to the crystallization of particular ideas, data sets, and boundaries as constitutive of those phenomena. Merry navigates United Nations and governmental offices, excavates resolutions and precedents, and traces reports circulating between international bodies to show how indicators come to articulate the relation between international and national contexts in the definition of these three areas of political intervention."
705,Summer comfort in a low-inertia building with a new free-cooling system,A. Brun;E. Wurtz;P. Hollmuller;D. Quenard,Applied Energy,"This paper investigates the possibility of reducing the energy use for cooling as well as improving the thermal comfort in lightweight buildings by associating new heat thermal energy storage (HTES) to the building HVAC system. The numerical model of the so-called “phase-shifter” HTES has been implemented on the SimSpark platform and validated against the analytical solution for the constant airflow and harmonic temperature profile. The experimental data has been used to assess its predictive capability with non-constant airflow. Using reduced ventilation periods has been numerically studied regarding the environmental air resource and thermal storage efficiency of the system. The size and electricity consumption were optimized by this way. Particularly, a comfort analysis based on the adaptive model was carried out on several combined building thermal inertia and HVAC configuration. The building energy simulation results demonstrate that the low-inertia building equipped with a phase-shifter presents the similar internal thermal conditions to those of a more massive night-ventilated structure. The proposed optimization can reduce significantly the size of the system (by 30%) and the electricity consumption (by at least 38%) while the temperature is out of the comfort range for an extra 5% of the total estimation period.A further prototype of air mass system, with storage in water nodules, is developed and tested.A transient Schumann model was experimentally tested under alternated airflow circulation.Thermal storage efficiency under intermittent ventilation was assessed.The coupling of the system with a lightweight building is simulated and the comfort analyzes were carried out.This paper investigates the possibility of reducing the energy use for cooling as well as improving the thermal comfort in lightweight buildings by associating new heat thermal energy storage (HTES) to the building HVAC system.

706,Summer temperature and summer monsoon history on the Tibetan plateau during the last 400 years recorded by tree rings,A. Bräuning;B. Mantwill,Geophysical Research Letters,"[1] Global circulation models predict an increase of summer monsoon precipitation in High Asia as a consequence of global warming. The shortness of available meteorological records requires the reconstruction of past climate variability. However, high‐resolution climate proxy records from the Tibetan plateau are scarce and of limited spatial representativeness. Here we present first evidence of increased summer monsoon intensity from the Tibetan plateau based on reconstructions of late summer (August and September) temperature and rainfall from a network of 22 maximum latewood density (MLD) chronologies of high‐elevation conifer sites. After 1980, a decrease in MLD points to an increase of Indian summer monsoon activity in southern Tibet unprecedented during the past 350 years."

Zhuang,Nature,"Metazoan genomes are spatially organized at multiple scales, from packaging of DNA around individual nucleosomes to segregation of whole chromosomes into distinct territories1,2,3,4,5. At the intermediate scale of kilobases to megabases, which encompasses the sizes of genes, gene clusters and regulatory domains, the three-dimensional (3D) organization of DNA is implicated in multiple gene regulatory mechanisms2,3,4,6,7,8, but understanding this organization remains a challenge. At this scale, the genome is partitioned into domains of different epigenetic states that are essential for regulating gene expression9,10,11. Here we investigate the 3D organization of chromatin in different epigenetic states using super-resolution imaging. We classified genomic domains in Drosophila cells into transcriptionally active, inactive or Polycomb-repressed states, and observed distinct chromatin organizations for each state. All three types of chromatin domains exhibit power-law scaling between their physical sizes in 3D and their domain lengths, but each type has a distinct scaling exponent. Polycomb-repressed domains show the densest packing and most intriguing chromatin folding behaviour, in which chromatin packing density increases with domain length. Distinct from the self-similar organization displayed by transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin, the Polycomb-repressed domains are characterized by a high degree of chromatin intermixing within the domain. Moreover, compared to inactive domains, Polycomb-repressed domains spatially exclude neighbouring active chromatin to a much stronger degree. Computational modelling and knockdown experiments suggest that reversible chromatin interactions mediated by Polycomb-group proteins play an important role in these unique packaging properties of the repressed chromatin. Taken together, our super-resolution images reveal distinct chromatin packaging for different epigenetic states at the kilobase-to-megabase scale, a length scale that is directly relevant to genome regulation.Metazoan genomes are spatially organized at multiple scales, from packaging of DNA around individual nucleosomes to segregation of whole chromosomes into distinct territories1,2,3,4,5.

709,Supervised Learning of Universal Sentence Representations from Natural Language Inference Data,A. Conneau;D. Kiela;H. Schwenk;L. Barrault;A. Bordes,ArXiv Computer Science,"Many modern NLP systems rely on word embeddings, previously trained in an unsupervised manner on large corpora, as base features. Efforts to obtain embeddings for larger chunks of text, such as sentences, have however not been so successful. Several attempts at learning unsupervised representations of sentences have not reached satisfactory enough performance to be widely adopted. In this paper, we show how universal sentence representations trained using the supervised data of the Stanford Natural Language Inference datasets can consistently outperform unsupervised methods like SkipThought vectors on a wide range of transfer tasks. Much like how computer vision uses ImageNet to obtain features, which can then be transferred to other tasks, our work tends to indicate the suitability of natural language inference for transfer learning to other NLP tasks. Our encoder is publicly available."

Relying on theoretical developments and empirical case studies, the authors propose a model, the “segmentation tree” model, for adopting a focused approach to SCM resulting in a SC strategy segmentation based on three drivers, namely product, brand and retail channel."
711,Surface tension gradient driven spreading of trisiloxane surfactant solution on hydrophobic solid,A. Chengara;A. Nikolov;D. Wasan,Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects,"The spreading of aqueous solutions of trisiloxane surfactant on hydrophobic surfaces has been studied extensively, but the underlying mechanisms are still being debated. Recently, we advanced the view that the initial high rate of spreading is driven by the surface tension gradient that develops spontaneously over the air–solution surface due to surfactant depletion caused by stretching of this surface. In this short paper, we substantiate this view with additional experiments. To understand the role of capillary forces, spreading experiments were conducted so that during the spreading of surfactant solution over the solid surface, the fluid displaced from the solid was an organic liquid instead of air as is the usual case. Through this scheme, the balance of forces at the three phase contact line was altered, while retaining the same surface tension gradient over the air–solution interface. Such experiments were also conducted on solid surfaces of different wettability, to examine the role of the solid–liquid interfacial tension on spreading rate. Our finding is that the initial rate of spreading is not influenced by the forces at the contact line or at the solid–solution interface, leading to the conclusion that the major driving force for spreading of trisiloxane surfactant solution on hydrophobic surfaces is the surface tension gradient over the air–solution surface. The occurrence of a maximum in spreading area with surfactant concentration is shown to be consistent with this mechanism. We also present a comparison between a simplified theoretical model and experiments to support the conclusion of surface tension gradient driven spreading.The spreading of aqueous solutions of trisiloxane surfactant on hydrophobic surfaces has been studied extensively, but the underlying mechanisms are still being debated.

712,Surveillance of risk profiles among new and repeat blood donors with transfusion‐transmissible infections from 1995 through 2003 in the Netherlands,A. Bij;R. Coutinho;C. Poel,Transfusion,"To evaluate the effectiveness of blood donor selection, this study reports risk profiles of donors with transfusion‐transmissible infections as obtained by ongoing surveillance, 1995 through 2003, in the Netherlands. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A surveillance program was installed to monitor risk profiles among new and repeat donors infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or human T‐lymphotropic virus (HTLV), or positive for the presence of syphilis antibodies. At posttest counseling, a physician interviewed donors to clarify possible sources of infection. RESULTS: A total of 167 repeat donors and 404 new donors were interviewed: 33 with HIV, 123 with HCV, 279 with HBV, 21 with HTLV, and 112 with syphilis antibodies. Most HBV, HCV, and HTLV infections were among new donors (80, 85, and 67%), whereas most HIV infections were among repeat donors (79%). Nearly 25 percent of the donors did not report factors at screening that would have deferred them from donating blood. At posttest interviews, new donors with HCV often reported injecting drug use (19%). Repeat donors with HIV often reported male‐to‐male sex (8/26, 31%). CONCLUSION: A significant level of deferrable behavioral risks was found among donors with confirmed transfusion‐transmissible infections that persist despite current donor selection. Reporting such behavior at initial donor selection would have eliminated a substantial part of the infections found. This study argues against relaxing the existing donor deferral of persons practicing male‐to‐male sex, given their significant proportion of HIV infections among repeat donors. Systematic surveillance of risk factors among infected blood donors provides ongoing information about the effectivity of donor selection and is recommended to evaluate and optimize blood policies."

In 24/34 (71%) treatment was considered technically successful, 22/24 (92%) were treated with PTRA+stent, two with only PTRA. Patients were followed for mean 2.6 (range 0–8) years, during which 14/34 (41%) patients died. In all 34 patients, systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) before treatment were 184±30/95±15 mmHg and had decreased at discharge (to 157±21/80±10 mmHg; P<0.001 for both SBP and DBP), and remained lower after 1 year (154±20/83±7 mmHg;P<0.001 for SBP and P<0.01 for DBP), and at last follow-up (148±20/80±12 mmHg; P<0.001 for both SBP and DBP). No changes occurred in s-creatinine or the number of antihypertensive drugs. Similar results were seen in the subgroup of 24/34 (71%) patients in whom treatment was technically successful.

Small, lightweight, low speed and agileUAVs, such as multi-rotors platforms can incorporate many kinds of sensors thatare suitable for detecting object of interests in cluttered outdoor areas.However, due to their limited endurance, moderate computing power, andimperfect sensing, mini-UAVs should be into groups using swarm coordinationalgorithms to perform tasks in a scalable, reliable and robust manner. In thispaper a biologically-inspired mechanisms is adopted to coordinate dronesperforming target search with imperfect sensors. In essence, coordination canbe achieved by combining stigmergic and flocking behaviors. Stigmergy occurswhen a drone releases digital pheromone upon sensing of a potential target.Such pheromones can be aggregated and diffused between flocking drones,creating a spatiotemporal attractive potential field. Flocking occurs, as anemergent effect of alignment, separation and cohesion, where drones selforganise with similar heading and dynamic arrangement as a group. The emergentcoordination of drones relies on the alignment of stigmergy and flockingstrategies. This paper reports on the design of the novel swarming algorithm,reviewing different strategies and measuring their performance on a number ofsynthetic and real-world scenarios."
715,Synchronization of solutions of Duffing-type equations with random perturbations,A. Ambrazevičius;F. Ivanauskas;V. Mackevičius,Nonlinear Analysis,"We consider a family of particles with different initial states and/or velocities whose dynamics is described by a Duffing-type equation ẍ+αẋ+P(x)=0 where the velocity v=ẋ is randomly perturbed at random times. We present sufficient conditions ensuring almost identical sample paths of the particles after a long time: the times between perturbations are assumed to be unbounded and uniformly positive, and the values of jumps are assumed to be random variables with positive density on a sufficiently large interval [0,H]. The paper generalizes the results of Ambrazevičius et al.

716,Synchronous and Stochastic Patterns of Gene Activation in the Drosophila Embryo,A. Boettiger;M. Levine,Science,"Drosophila embryogenesis is characterized by rapid transitions in gene activity, whereby crudely distributed gradients of regulatory proteins give way to precise on/off patterns of gene expression. To explore the underlying mechanisms, a partially automated, quantitative in situ hybridization method was used to visualize expression profiles of 14 developmental control genes in hundreds of embryos. These studies revealed two distinct patterns of gene activation: synchronous and stochastic. Synchronous genes display essentially uniform expression of nascent transcripts in all cells of an embryonic tissue, whereas stochastic genes display erratic patterns of de novo activation. RNA polymerase II is “pre-loaded” (stalled) in the promoter regions of synchronous genes, but not stochastic genes. Transcriptional synchrony might ensure the orderly deployment of the complex gene regulatory networks that control embryogenesis."
717,Synergistic effects of Ir–Au/TiO2 catalysts in the total oxidation of propene: influence of the activation conditions,A. Aguilar-Tapia;R. Zanella;C. Calers;C. Louis;L. Delannoy,Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,"Iridium was added to the Au/TiO2 system to try to enhance its catalytic activity in the reaction of propene oxidation, performed under conditions close to those used in the studies of decomposition of volatile organic compounds (1200 ppm propene and 9 vol% O2 in He). Titania supported Ir–Au (Ir/Au = 1) was prepared by sequential deposition–precipitation with urea (DPU) of Ir then Au. The effect of the activation conditions (hydrogen or air at 400 °C) was investigated. The study of the activation conditions of Ir–Au/TiO2 showed that activation under hydrogen at 400 °C generated a catalyst more active than the monometallic ones, while Ir–Au/TiO2 activated in air remained as poorly active as Au/TiO2. TEM characterization showed the formation of metallic particles of similar size (2–3 nm) in both monometallic Au/TiO2 and bimetallic Ir–Au/TiO2. Characterization especially by DRIFTS using CO as a probe molecule suggests the presence of Ir–Au interaction, IrO2–Au0 interaction when the sample is calcined and Ir0–Au0 bimetallic particles when it is reduced. XPS and TPR characterization techniques showed that gold hinders to some extent the reoxidation of iridium in the reduced bimetallic Ir–Au/TiO2 catalyst. The enhanced catalytic activity of the reduced bimetallic Ir–Au/TiO2 catalyst is attributed to a surface Ir0–Au0 synergism."

Zarębska;M. Skompska,Electrochimica Acta,"Visible-driven photocatalyst was prepared by deposition of CdS by SILAR (successive ion layer adsorption and reaction) method on mesoporous N-doped TiO2 supported on F-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate. The changes of morphology and optical properties of the samples with increasing amount of CdS were monitored. The edges of conduction bands of both semiconductors were determined from Mott-Schottky plots. The system with CdS deposited in 6 SILAR cycles has been tested in photocatalytic decomposition of 4-chlorophenol. The mechanism of photocatalytic reaction was discussed in terms of the role of hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals in the process. A thin film of conducting polymer, poly(1,8-diaminocarbazole) deposited on the surface of TiO2/CdS suppressed photocorrosion of CdS during photocatalytic process. The amount of the polymer was optimized taking into account concentration of Cd2+ ions released to the solution and activity of the system in 4-CP degradation."

The antioxidative activity of the compounds was evaluated by DPPH-scavenging activity and cyclic voltammetry assays. While adjacent 6- and 7-hydroxyl groups in coumarins made a major contribution to antioxidative power and a decrease of ROS production relative to esculetin, a p-methoxy-substituted phenyl moiety had an impact on pronounced and selective antiproliferative activity against chronic leukemia cells in blast crisis (K562) with no significant change in the ROS generation. 6,7-Dihydroxycoumarin can be considered as a promising scaffold with a major contribution to antioxidant potential and, thereby, further structural modification of 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin linked to aryl-1,2,3-triazole may provide a hybrid molecule that may be of interest for potential application to prevent diseases related to the oxidative-stress imbalance."
724,Synthesis of Al–Si nano-template substrates for surface-enhanced Raman scattering application,A. Bendavid;P. Martin;C. Comte;L. Randeniya;D. Weller,Thin Solid Films,"Al–Si nano-porous templates were prepared using filtered cathodic vacuum arc deposition and investigated as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) active substrates. Al–Si thin films were deposited onto silicon substrates followed by immersion in ammonia solution to remove the aluminium columns to form a nano-porous structure. The pore size and density were controlled mainly by the deposition bias voltage applied to the substrate. Gold particles were deposited onto the nano-porous Al–Si templates by displacement deposition in a solution containing HAuCl4 (0.1 mM). The size and dispersion of the deposited Au particles were controlled by the concentration of Au ions, the immersion time and morphology of the Al–Si template. The SERS-activity was measured with Cresyl Violet (C25N3H30Cl) dye as the target molecule, and the enhancement was influenced by the morphology of the nano-porous Al–Si templates. As the pore size decreased a higher density of nucleation sites for the growth of Au nanoparticles was formed resulting in a shorter inter-particle spacing of Au particles, and an enhancement of the Raman signal."

Results from anti-bacterial evaluations of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria revealed that both o-chlorophenyl-1,2,3-triazole and N-isopropylamidine moieties in 8c led to strong inhibitory activity against resistant Gram-positive bacteria, particularly the MRSA strain. Furthermore, the non-substituted amidine and phenyl ring in 7a induced a marked anti-bacterial effect, with potency against ESBL-producing Gram-negative E. coli better than those of the antibiotics ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin. UV–Vis and CD spectroscopy, as well as thermal denaturation assays, indicated that compounds 7a and 8c showed also binding affinities towards ctDNA. Anti-trypanosomal evaluations showed that the p-methoxyphenyl-1,2,3-triazole moiety in 7b and 9b enhanced inhibitory activity against T. brucei, with 8b being more potent than nifurtimox, and having minimal toxicity towards mammalian cells.Graphical Abstract"

Both the Schiff’s base ligand and its complexes have been screened for antibacterial activities.Novel Schiff’s base complexes were synthesized.The complexes are characterized by different spectroscopic techniques.Thermogravimetric parameters of metal(II) complexes were calculated in different methods.Complexes were found more biologically sensitive than ligand.Complexes of manganese(II), cobalt(II), nickel(II), copper(II) and zinc(II) of general composition [M(L)2] have been synthesized [L = 4-pyridin-2-yl-methylene amino-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol]. The elemental analyses, molar conductance, spectral (IR, UV–Vis, 1H NMR, mass), magnetic moment and thermal measurements studies of the compounds led to the conclusion that the ligand acts as a tridentate manner (SNN). The molar conductance of the metal complexes in fresh solution of DMSO lies in the range of 8.34–10.46 Ω−1 cm2 mol−1 indicating their non-electrolytic behavior. On the basis of analytical and spectroscopic techniques, octahedral geometry of the complexes was proposed. The Schiff base acts as tridentate ligand coordinated through deprotonated thiolic sulfur, azomethine nitrogen and pyridine nitrogen atoms. The ligand field parameters were calculated for Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes and their values were found in the range reported for a octahedral structure. The data show that the complexes have composition of ML2 type.

Abou-Hussein;W. Linert,Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy,"Two series of new mono and binuclear complexes with a Schiff base ligand derived from the condensation of 3-acetylcoumarine and diethylenetriamine, in the molar ratio 2:1 have been prepared. The ligand was characterized by elemental analysis, IR, UV–visible, 1H-NMR and mass spectra. The reaction of the Schiff base ligand with cobalt(II), nickel(II), copper(II), zinc(II) and oxovanadium(IV) lead to mono or binuclear species of cyclic or macrocyclic complexes, depending on the mole ratio of metal to ligand and as well as on the method of preparation. The Schiff base ligand behaves as a cyclic bidentate, tetradendate or pentaentadentae ligand. The formation of macrocyclic complexes depends significantly on the dimension of the internal cavity, the rigidity of the macrocycles, the nature of its donor atoms and on the complexing properties of the anion involved in the coordination. Electronic spectra and magnetic moments of the complexes indicate that the geometries of the metal centers are either square pyramidal or octahedral for acyclic or macro-cyclic complexes. The structures are consistent with the IR, UV–visible, ESR, 1H-NMR, mass spectra as well as conductivity and magnetic moment measurements.

743,"Syn‐depositional thin‐ and thick‐skinned extensional tectonics in the mid‐Cretaceous Lasarte sub‐basin, western Pyrenees",A. Bodego;L. Agirrezabala,Basin Research,"In the mid‐Cretaceous Lasarte sub‐basin (LSB) [northeastern Basque‐Cantabrian Basin (BCB)] contemporaneous and syn‐depositional thin‐ and thick‐skinned extensional tectonics occur due to the presence of a ductile detachment layer that decoupled the extension. Despite the interest in extension modes of rift basins bearing intra‐stratal detachment layers, complex cases remain poorly understood. In the LSB, field results based on mapping, stratigraphic, sedimentological and structural data show the relationship between growth strata and tectonic structures. Syn‐depositional extensional listric faults and associated folds and faults have been identified in the supra‐detachment thin‐skinned system. But stratigraphic data also indicate the activation of sub‐detachment thick‐skinned extensional faults coeval with the development of the thin‐skinned system. The tectono‐sedimentary evolution of the LSB, since the Late Aptian until the earliest Late Albian, has been interpreted based on thin‐ and thick‐skinned extensional growth structures, which are fossilized by post‐extensional strata. The development of the thin‐skinned system is attributed to the presence of a ductile detachment layer (Upper Triassic Keuper facies) which decoupled the extension from deeper sub‐detachment basement‐involved faulting under a regional extensional/transtensional regime."
744,"System reliability, performance and trust in adaptable automation",A. Chavaillaz;D. Wastell;J. Sauer,Applied Ergonomics,"The present study examined the effects of reduced system reliability on operator performance and automation management in an adaptable automation environment. 39 operators were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: low (60%), medium (80%), and high (100%) reliability of automation support. The support system provided five incremental levels of automation which operators could freely select according to their needs. After 3 h of training on a simulated process control task (AutoCAMS) in which the automation worked infallibly, operator performance and automation management were measured during a 2.5-h testing session. Trust and workload were also assessed through questionnaires. Results showed that although reduced system reliability resulted in lower levels of trust towards automation, there were no corresponding differences in the operators' reliance on automation. While operators showed overall a noteworthy ability to cope with automation failure, there were, however, decrements in diagnostic speed and prospective memory with lower reliability."

746,TERSE-KF: Event-Trigger Diffusion Kalman Filter with Application to Localization and Time Synchronization,A. Alanwar;T. Chang;M. Srivastava;A. Mehta,ArXiv Computer Science,"The performance of a distributed network state estimation problem depends strongly on collaborative signal processing, which often involves excessive communication and computation overheads on a resource-constrained sensor node. In this work, we approach the distributed estimation problem from the viewpoint of sensor networks to design a more efficient algorithm with reduced overheads, while still achieving the required performance bounds on the results. We propose an event-trigger diffusion Kalman filter, specifying when to communicate relative measurements between nodes based on a local signal indicative of the network error performance. This holistic approach leads to an energy-aware state estimation algorithm, which we then apply to the distributed simultaneous localization and time synchronization problem. We analytically prove that this algorithm leads to bounded error performance. Our algorithm is then evaluated on a physical testbed of a mobile quadrotor node moving through a network of stationary custom ultra-wideband wireless devices. We observe the trade-off between communication cost and error performance. For instance, we are able to save 86% of the communication overhead, while introducing 16% degradation in the performance."

750,Tailoring electronic and thermal transport properties of CaO(CaMnO 3 ) m -based (m=1 and m=∞) composites for thermoelectric power generation,A. Azulay;Y. Amouyal,Acta Materialia,"Oxide thermoelectric (TE) materials are promising for waste heat recovery at high temperatures thanks to their good chemical stability at elevated temperatures and low cost. We study Nb-doped n-type TE oxides of the CaO(CaMnO3)m-series. The CaMnO3 (m = ∞) and Ca2MnO4 (m = 1) derivatives feature extremely opposite transport coefficients, where the m = ∞ structure exhibits high electrical and thermal conductivity, and the m = 1 derivative exhibits the opposite combination. We synthesize composite materials based on these two phases of different ratios to draw correlations between the TE properties, microstructure evolution, and composition of the material. We determine the optimum sintering temperature to be 1373 K, and measure both thermal and electronic transport coefficients, then perform a thorough general effective medium (GEM) analysis. Interestingly, we find that most ratios obey to the GEM behavior, where deviations are elucidated in terms of interfacial effects. This study provides us with tools for identifying the significance of bulk vs. interfacial effects in design of composite materials with controllable transport properties."

Sahoo,Scientific Reports (Physics),"The interplay between superconductivity (SC) and ferromagnetism (FM) when embedded together has attracted unprecedented research interest due to very rare coexistence of these two phenomena. The focus has been mainly put into the proximity induced effects like, coexistence of magnetism and superconductivity, higher critical current, triplet superconductivity etc. However, very little attention has been paid experimentally to the role of magnetic constituent on triggering phase slip processes in the composite films (CFs). We demonstrate that less than 1 at.% of magnetic contribution in the CFs can initiate phase slip events efficiently. Due to advanced state-of-the-art fabrication techniques, phase slip based studies have been concentrated mainly on superconducting nanostructures. Here, we employ wide mesoscopic NbGd based CFs to study the phase slip processes. Low temperature current-voltage characteristics (IVCs) of CFs show stair-like features originated through phase slip events and are absent in pure SC films. Depending on the bias current and temperature, distinct regions, dominated by Abrikosov type vortex-antivortex (v-av) pairs and phase slip events, are observed. The results presented here open a new way to study the phase slip mechanism, its interaction with v-av pairs in two dimensions and hence can be useful for future photonic and metrological applications.The interplay between superconductivity (SC) and ferromagnetism (FM) when embedded together has attracted unprecedented research interest due to very rare coexistence of these two phenomena.

Ub/Ubl-mediated signaling is initiated through E1, E2, and E3-mediated conjugation, transduced by proteins that recognize Ub/Ubl-modified substrates, and terminated by proteases which remove the Ub/Ubl from the substrate. Recent structural studies have elucidated mechanisms pertinent to Ub/Ubl conjugation, recognition, and deconjugation, highlighting essential steps during Ub/Ubl modification that illustrate common and divergent mechanistic themes within this important process."

754,"Targeted therapies of solid cancers: new options, new challenges",A. Awada;P. Aftimos,Current Opinion in Oncology,"Purpose of review: The landscape of medical oncology is filled with approvals of new anticancer agents, the majority of which are targeted agents. This shift in therapies raises multiple challenges including the appearance of new toxicities, the need for biomarkers , the emergence of genomics and the evolution of cancer molecular imaging. Recent findings: Biopsy of metastatic lesions is slowly becoming a standard of care before the initiation of any therapy. These invasive procedures have been found to be generally well tolerated and are being put to use with the emergence of genomics. Gene sequencing and new imaging techniques are serving the understanding of tumor biology and the search for ‘ biomarkers ’ predicting response and resistance to treatment. New clinical trial designs incorporating the ‘presumed’ biomarkers are guiding patients to specific treatments and have shown outcome improvements. Summary: Many questions remain however unanswered and new challenges appear. Intratumor heterogeneity emerges as a brake to personalized cancer care . Relevant targets remain undruggable and costs may hinder progress. Furthermore, technical issues continue to arise. The ultimate goal remains to achieve cure by blocking the multiple pathways of cancer development and proliferation, while sparing the patients the burden of therapy."
755,Targets of Balancing Selection in the Human Genome,A. Andrés;M. Hubisz;A. Indap;D. Torgerson;J. Degenhardt,Molecular Biology and Evolution,"Balancing selection is potentially an important biological force for maintaining advantageous genetic diversity in populations, including variation that is responsible for long-term adaptation to the environment. By serving as a means to maintain genetic variation, it may be particularly relevant to maintaining phenotypic variation in natural populations. Nevertheless, its prevalence and specific targets in the human genome remain largely unknown. We have analyzed the patterns of diversity and divergence of 13,400 genes in two human populations using an unbiased single-nucleotide polymorphism data set, a genome-wide approach, and a method that incorporates demography in neutrality tests. We identified an unbiased catalog of genes with signatures of long-term balancing selection, which includes immunity genes as well as genes encoding keratins and membrane channels; the catalog also shows enrichment in functional categories involved in cellular structure. Patterns are mostly concordant in the two populations, with a small fraction of genes showing population-specific signatures of selection. Power considerations indicate that our findings represent a subset of all targets in the genome, suggesting that although balancing selection may not have an obvious impact on a large proportion of human genes, it is a key force affecting the evolution of a number of genes in humans."
756,Tax decentralization notwithstanding regional disparities,A. Bellofatto;M. Besfamille,CESifo Working Papers,"In assessing the desirability for tax decentralization reforms, a dilemma between efficiency and redistribution emerges. By limiting the ability of the central government to redistribute resources towards regions in financial needs, decentralization curbs incentives for excessive subnational spending and enhances fiscal discipline, but may also widen interregional disparities by triggering tax competition for mobile tax bases. We provide a formal treatment of this trade-off, and shed light on the optimal degree of fiscal decentralization. We find that tax decentralization can be optimal even under Rawlsian social preferences which only weight the welfare of the poorest region in the federation."
757,"Taxon specific response of carabids (Coleoptera, Carabidae) and other soil invertebrate taxa on invasive plant Amorpha fruticosa in wetlands",A. Brigić;S. Vujčić-Karlo;R. Kepčija;Z. Stančić;A. Alegro;I. Ternjej,Biological Invasions,"False indigo (Amorpha fruticosa L.) is an invasive exotic plant introduced to Europe in the early eighteenth century. Its spread has been rapid, particularly in disturbed wetland habitats, where it forms dense impermeable monospecific stands and modifies habitat conditions. The impact of A. fruticosa on native plant communities has been well analyzed, however knowledge concerning the possible effects on soil invertebrates and particularly carabid beetles is completely lacking. This study analyzed the impact of an A. fruticosa invasion on carabid beetles and other soil invertebrates. Soil fauna was sampled by pitfall traps at natural habitats, initially colonized by A. fruticosa, and habitats largely invaded by A. fruticosa. In total 2,613 carabid beetles belonging to 50 species and 72,166 soil invertebrates were collected. The invasion of A. fruticosa strongly affected the carabid beetle species composition, which clearly differed between all studied sites. Widespread euritopic carabid beetle species showed positive responses to A. fruticosa invasion, while the activity density of open habitat species strongly declined. Mean individual biomass was significantly higher at invaded sites due to increased incidence of large carabids (genus Carabus Linné, 1758). Carabid beetle activity density and abundance of soil invertebrates were considerably higher at invaded sites than in natural sites. Conversely, the impact of A. fruticosa on carabid beetle species richness and diversity was less pronounced, most likely due to immigration from adjacent habitats. Changes in carabid beetle species composition and abundance of soil invertebrates were most likely due to changes in vegetation structure and microclimate. The results suggest that A. fruticosa invasion considerably affected carabid beetles, an insect group that is only indirectly related to plant composition. Therefore, severe future changes can be expected in invertebrate groups that are closely related to plant composition, since A. fruticosa cannot be completely removed from the habitat and covers relatively large areas."
758,Technical-economic feasibility of CHP systems in large hospitals through the Energy Hub method: The case of Cagliari AOB,A. Biglia;F. Caredda;E. Fabrizio;M. Filippi;N. Mandas,Energy and Buildings,"Multi-energy systems satisfy different energy uses of a building such as space heating, space cooling, DHW, etc. by using different energy converters and energy sources simultaneously. These systems, if properly designed and operated, have high efficiency in the production of energy.This paper presents a method based on the Energy Hub model for the energy and economic analysis of a large hospital complex placed in Sardinia (Italy). The Energy Hub model allows dynamic simulations results and experimental data to be coupled. First of all, the model was calibrated according to real data and information obtained during an energy audit carried out by the University of Cagliari in collaboration with the Brotzu Hospital staff. Then, since cogeneration is recognised as one of the most effective ways to efficiently convert energy, the integration of a CHP system (internal combustion engine), within the multi-energy system of the hospital, was studied. The results obtained are useful to identify benefits that might be obtained by the CHP system, depending on its regulation and on the economic variables.The presented model represents a valuable tool to evaluate possible energy and economic savings and to design and to optimise every kind of multi-energy systems of a generic building."
759,Technik der Koronaranastomosen,A. Böning;F. Eckstein;M. Grimm;A. Moritz,Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,"Die Koronarchirurgie stellt nach wie vor den häufigsten herzchirurgischen Eingriff dar. Der derzeit erreichbare technische Perfektionsgrad ist ausgesprochen hoch und gerade die Dauerhaftigkeit der chirurgisch hergestellten Koronaranastomosen bedingt deren Überlegenheit hinsichtlich der Langzeitergebnisse im Vergleich zur Stenttherapie, wie dies die Serie der SYNTAX-Publikationen zeigt. Die Konkurrenzfähigkeit der chirurgischen Therapie der koronaren Herzkrankheit hängt nicht zuletzt von der Qualität der Koronaranastomosen ab. Diese werden sehr häufig hergestellt. Dennoch variiert deren Technik relativ stark. Es war daher das Anliegen, die Techniken verschiedener Institutionen (Gießen, Basel, Innsbruck) darzustellen und zu erklären. Erfragt war insbesondere die Technik der längsgerichteten End-zu-Seit-Anastomose sowie der quer- und längsgerichteten Seit-zu-Seit-Anastomose. Coronary surgery still represents the most common cardiac surgical intervention. The currently achievable technical degree of perfection is very high and especially the durability of the surgically created coronary anastomosis determines the superiority in the long-term results in comparison to stent therapy, as the series of Syntax publications shows. The ability of surgical therapy of coronary heart disease to compete depends not only on the quality of the coronary anastomosis, which are commonly used. However, the technique varies relatively strong. It was, therefore, the goal to present and explain the techniques of the different institutions (Gießen, Basel, Innsbruck). Special interest has been placed on lateral end-to-side anastomosis as well as the longitudinal and lateral side-to-side anastomosis."
760,Technological challenges for industrial development of hydrogen production based on methane cracking,A. Abánades;C. Rubbia;D. Salmieri,Energy,"The world energy demand is foreseen to increase due to the improvements of the living standard in the developing countries and to the development of the global economy. The increase in sustainability of the energy supply must be considered as a must to avoid spoiling the natural resources, whose availability will be crucial for next generations. The CO2-free utilization of available energy sources is one of the ways to attain such objectives. Innovative solutions should be put into practice for the CO2-free exploitation of the huge fossil fuel resources already available. In this paper we explore the possibility to enlarge the fossil fuel availability without CO2 emissions by the analysis of the technological options to obtain Hydrogen as energy carrier from hydrocarbon decarburation, mainly methane. A brief analysis of those options and a discussion about their state-of-the-art will be done, to establish their potential and the R&D required to assess their practical implementation in a medium term."

Evans,International Journal of Refrigeration,"This paper reports the results of a large-scale survey in which 998 cold appliances were monitored in 766 properties in England. No surveys published to date analyse such a large dataset, which includes data on ambient temperature, cold appliance temperature (refrigerator and/or freezer) and electricity consumption of the cold appliance.Simultaneous measurements of the temperature inside and outside of the cold appliances and the electricity consumption were taken over a period of seven days during a nine-month period in 2015.

762,Temporal clustering of gene expression links the metabolic transcription factor HNF4α to the ER stress-dependent gene regulatory network,A. Arensdorf;D. Mccabe;R. Kaufman;D. Rutkowski,Frontiers in Genetics,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) responds to disruption of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function by initiating signaling cascades that ultimately culminate in extensive transcriptional regulation. Classically, this regulation includes genes encoding ER chaperones, ER-associated degradation factors, and others involved in secretory protein folding and processing, and is carried out by the transcriptional activators that are produced as a consequence of UPR activation. However, up to half of the mRNAs regulated by ER stress are downregulated rather than upregulated, and the mechanisms linking ER stress and UPR activation to mRNA suppression are poorly understood. To begin to address this issue, we used a “bottom-up” approach to study the metabolic gene regulatory network controlled by the UPR in the liver, because ER stress in the liver leads to lipid accumulation, and fatty liver disease is the most common liver disease in the western world. qRT-PCR profiling of mouse liver mRNAs during ER stress revealed that suppression of the transcriptional regulators C/EBPα, PPARα, and PGC-1α preceded lipid accumulation, and was then followed by suppression of mRNAs encoding key enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation and lipoprotein biogenesis and transport. Mice lacking the ER stress sensor ATF6α, which experience persistent ER stress and profound lipid accumulation during challenge, were then used as the basis for a functional genomics approach that allowed genes to be grouped into distinct expression profiles. This clustering predicted that ER stress would suppress the activity of the metabolic transcriptional regulator HNF4α—a finding subsequently confirmed by chromatin immunopreciptation at the Cebpa and Pgc1a promoters. Our results establish a framework for hepatic gene regulation during ER stress and suggest that HNF4α occupies the apex of that framework. They also provide a unique resource for the community to further explore the temporal regulation of gene expression during ER stress in vivo ."

764,Terrestrial isopods (Isopoda: Oniscidea) as unexpected inhabitants of extreme habitats,A. Brigić;I. Antonović;A. Alegro;V. Šegota;J. Bujan,European Journal of Soil Biology,"Peat bogs, naturally acidic environments, are extreme habitats for many soil macroorganisms. Soil acidity and reduced calcium availability strongly affect soil invertebrates, which require calcium to build exoskeletons. Calcium availability is assumed to limit survival of terrestrial isopods in this nutrient-poor environment. Previous studies, though scarce, have shown that isopods are absent from peat bogs in the north Holarctic. Thus, they were sampled using pitfall traps in the largest and oldest Western Balkans (Croatia) peat bog and at its edges. Isopods were found to maintain stable populations in the Western Balkan peat bogs, despite the extreme soil properties. Species richness did not differ between the centre of the peat bog and its edge, however activity density was higher at the edge, implying that edges provide more favourable habitat for isopods based on microclimatic conditions, food availability, and shelter sites. Calcium concentration is not the key limiting factor for isopod distribution in peat bogs as previously assumed. Environmental variables that impacted isopod spatial distribution include soil moisture and vegetation structure. Thus, presence of isopods in Southern European peat bogs is likely related to warmer climate and successional changes in peat bogs.Terrestrial isopods maintain stable populations in the Southern European Đon močvar peat bog.Despite prior assumptions, high acidity and low calcium availability are not key limiting factors for woodlice distribution.Occurrence of woodlice in Southern European peat bogs is likely related to successional changes and warmer climate.Active conservation measures are essential to preserve this fragile ecosystem and its unique soil assemblages.Peat bogs, naturally acidic environments, are extreme habitats for many soil macroorganisms.

766,Tests and intervals in multiple choice tests: A modification of the simplest classical model,A. Andrés;J. Castillo,British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology,"When a multiple choice test is carried out, each student is set the same series of questions composed of two or more alternatives, only one of which is correct, and from which he or she must choose only one. The simplest and most common criterion for deciding what a student knows is based on a sole and minimum quota for all the students of the total number of right answers; this criterion derives from the assumption that the student, when he or she does not know the correct answer to a question, answers any of the possible alternatives with equal probability."
767,Tests of Gaussianity,A. Aliaga;E. Martı́Nez-González;L. Cayón;F. Argüeso;J. Gallegos,New Astronomy Reviews,We review two powerful methods to test the Gaussianity of the cosmic microwave background (CMB): one based on the distribution of spherical wavelet coefficients and the other on smooth tests of goodness-of-fit. The spherical wavelet families proposed to analyse the CMB are the Haar and the Mexican Hat ones. The latter is preferred for detecting non-Gaussian homogeneous and isotropic primordial models containing some amount of skewness or kurtosis. Smooth tests of goodness-of-fit have recently been introduced in the field showing some interesting properties. We will discuss the smooth tests of goodness-of-fit developed by Rayner and Best for the univariate as well as for the multivariate analysis.We review two powerful methods to test the Gaussianity of the cosmic microwave background (CMB): one based on the distribution of spherical wavelet coefficients and the other on smooth tests of goodness-of-fit.

768,Texture and microstructure development during intercritical rolling of low-carbon steels,A. Bodin;J. Sietsman;S. Zwaag,Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A,"Laboratory rolling trials have been performed to investigate the development of microstructure and crystallographic texture during and after intercritical rolling. The finishing temperature was varied over a wide range, and samples were taken just prior to the last pass, after quenching following the last pass, after air cooling and coiling, and after accelerated cooling and coiling. Cooling of the samples to the entry temperature for the last pass does not influence the texture of the sample, nor do higher cooling rates after austenitic finishing within the range of cooling rates in this study, although it may cause a refinement of the ferrite grains. Recrystallization after intercritical rolling leads to a decrease in texture intensity. In the case of recrystallization of low-carbon steels, the nucleation mechanism is strain-induced boundary migration (SIBM), which leads to unfavorable textures for deep drawing. In the case of recrystallization of interstitial-free (IF) steel after ferritic rolling, the nucleation mechanism shifts from the SIBM mechanism at high finishing temperatures to subgrain coalescence at (SGC) low finishing temperatures. The latter mechanism leads to more favorable textures for deep-drawing applications. Transformation-induced (TI) nucleation explains the occurrence of a sudden increase in ferrite grain size after high-temperature intercritical deformation of low-carbon (LC) steels."
769,The Anthropology of Water,A. Ballestero,Annual Review of Anthropology,"The anthropology of water is a self-declared relational field that attempts to transcend nature/culture distinctions by attending to the fact that the social and ecological aspects of water are separated only by convention. Despite its recent coming of age, the anthropology of water is incredibly expansive. It attends to molecular, embodied, ecosystemic, and planetary issues. I provide an overview of that breadth in four thematic clusters: (in)sufficiency, bodies and beings, knowledge, and ownership. These clusters highlight issues of materiality, ontological politics, and political economy. They are the grounds on which questions of water justice are elucidated. Furthermore, I show how water is always more than itself; its force and material presence constantly frame people's efforts to address the fundamental question of what it means to live life collectively in a world that is always more than human. I close with two directions for research: the denaturalization of water's materiality and the diversification of the moral undertones of our analytic vocabularies."
770,The C. elegans Connectome Consists of Homogenous Circuits with Defined Functional Roles,A. Azulay;E. Itskovits;A. Zaslaver,PLOS Computational Biology,"A major goal of systems neuroscience is to decipher the structure-function relationship in neural networks. Here we study network functionality in light of the common-neighbor-rule (CNR) in which a pair of neurons is more likely to be connected the more common neighbors it shares. Focusing on the fully-mapped neural network of C. elegans worms, we establish that the CNR is an emerging property in this connectome. Moreover, sets of common neighbors form homogenous structures that appear in defined layers of the network. Simulations of signal propagation reveal their potential functional roles: signal amplification and short-term memory at the sensory/inter-neuron layer, and synchronized activity at the motoneuron layer supporting coordinated movement. A coarse-grained view of the neural network based on homogenous connected sets alone reveals a simple modular network architecture that is intuitive to understand. These findings provide a novel framework for analyzing larger, more complex, connectomes once these become available."
771,"The CARLIT method for the assessment of the ecological quality of European Mediterranean waters: Relevance, robustness and possible improvements",A. Blanfuné;T. Thibaut;C. Boudouresque;V. Mačić;P. Boissery,Ecological Indicators,"The application of the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires the assessment of the ecological status (ES) of coastal waters in order to detect environmental changes and implement management plans to prevent their further deterioration. The ES of a water body (WB) has to be assessed on the basis of the status of several biological indicators, referred to as biological quality elements (BQE), such as phytoplankton, macroalgae, seagrasses, macroinvertebrates and fish. We present the most extensive assessment ever undertaken of the ES of Mediterranean waters, by means of the CARLIT index, the most widely used index for the Mediterranean Sea. This index is based on the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) between a measured value of Ecological Quality (EQ) and a value corresponding to a reference site. This assessment is based on an extensive field study, covering the whole of the Mediterranean French coasts (including Corsica), 40 WBs and ∼2 970 kilometres of shore (at a 1/2 500 scale). The original Ballesteros CARLIT method is compared to the Nikolić modified method, and we have undertaken the challenge of developing an alternative new simplified CARLIT method. This simplified method, which requires less expert judgement, is easier to implement by local authorities, and provides results similar overall to those of the original method. Previous attempts, if any, to correlate EQRs with anthropogenic stressors (through pressure indices) were mainly based upon land uses or on comprehensive lists of stressors, some spatially very sporadic, temporally highly variable, non-representative of the WB and with the impact poorly established on species and communities. To date, the LUSI (Land Uses Simplified Index) and the MA-LUSI-WB have been the most widely used pressure indices. Here, we propose a new pressure index (HAPI) taking into consideration the possible shortcomings of previous indices. It takes into account the actual pressures at community levels considered by the CARLIT method. It accounts well for the EQR values of the study area, as evidenced by the high correlation coefficient between EQRs and HAPI, better than that of the other pressure indices. The present study provides a comprehensive view of the ES of the French Mediterranean coasts. Surprisingly, the picture is far less cause for concern than expected, although this could result from an artefact due to the focus on superficial waters and habitats inherent to the CARLIT method. Where two successive assessments were performed (23 WBs, 2007–2010 vs 2012–2015), the results were similar, which stresses the robustness of the method and/or the relative stability over time of the overall ES of the WBs, and suggests that the successive assessments could be carried out at low frequency.The application of the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires the assessment of the ecological status (ES) of coastal waters in order to detect environmental changes and implement management plans to prevent their further deterioration.

773,The Effect of Vent Size on Pressure Generation in Explosions in Large L/D Vessels,A. Alexiou;H. Phylaktou;G. Andrews,Combustion Science and Technology,"There is a need for more explosion relief data in large L/D vessels. In this paper we report an experimental investigation of the effect of vent size on the overpressure development in a large L/D, end-vented vessel. Three pressure peaks were identified: P 1 due to an initial elongated flame (characteristic of large L/D explosions); P 2 due to turbulent combustion in the middle and end sections of the vessel and P 3 due to the external explosion. P 1 was found to be the dominant overpressure for small vent areas and to increase with decreasing vent size, whereas the flame speed was reduced (as well as P 2 and P 3) due to reduction of unburnt gas flow through and out of the vessel."
774,The Financial Secrecy Index: Shedding New Light on the Geography of Secrecy,A. Cobham;P. Janský;M. Meinzer,Economic Geography,"Both academic research and public policy debate around tax havens and offshore finance typically suffer from a lack of definitional consistency. Unsurprisingly then, there is little agreement about which jurisdictions ought to be considered as tax havens—or which policy measures would result in their not being so considered. In this article we explore and make operational an alternative concept, that of a secrecy jurisdiction and present the findings of the resulting Financial Secrecy Index (FSI). The FSI ranks countries and jurisdictions according to their contribution to opacity in global financial flows, revealing a quite different geography of financial secrecy from the image of small island tax havens that may still dominate popular perceptions and some of the literature on offshore finance. Some major (secrecy-supplying) economies now come into focus. Instead of a binary division between tax havens and others, the results show a secrecy spectrum, on which all jurisdictions can be situated, and that adjustment for the scale of business is necessary in order to compare impact propensity. This approach has the potential to support more precise and granular research findings and policy recommendations."

Subjects chose the onomatopoeia that best represented the sound of eating a fruit or vegetable (celery, banana, strawberry, passion fruit, mango, apple, orange, and tomato). Results show there are onomatopoeias that have a higher frequency of response in one language compared to the others. Thus, it is possible to assume that depending on the language there is a better way to express haptic and auditory information associated to fruit and vegetable consumption. Moreover, and considering the three languages, results show there are three categories of responses based on the relative strength of the material (strong and medium strength, and soft). Thus, there is some consistency in the onomatopoeias that represent the sound of eating a fruit or a vegetable.

776,The GABAA receptor complex in the developing chick optic tectum: characterization of [3H]muscimol binding sites,A. Batuecas;A. Cubero;A. Barat;G. Ramírez,Neurochemistry International,"As part of an ongoing study on the GABAA receptor complex in the developing chick optic tectum we describe some properties of the agonist site, as labeled by [3H]muscimol, including methodological, kinetic and pharmacological aspects. 16-day embryos and 10-day chicks have been selected as representative age points for the initial characterization of the receptor, prior to more detailed developmental studies. Our data indicate the existence, in both embryos and young birds, of a single class of statistically equivalent, high-affinity, saturable binding sites, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 80–90 nM in freeze-thawed/washed membranes, and about 8 nM in membranes additionally extracted with low concentrations of Triton X-100. Maximal densities of binding sites are nearly identical in both membrane preparations, ranging from ∼2 to ∼3 pmol/mg for the two age points considered.The pharmacological profiles suggest that avian receptors for [3H]muscimol are generally similar to the corresponding mammalian sites, behaving as typical bicuculline-sensitive, baclofen-insensitive type A GABA receptor sites. However, bicuculline and its derivatives are less efficient displacers of [3H]muscimol in detergent-extracted membrane preparations, being in all cases, as usually, much less effective displacers than GABA agonists.The effect of Triton X-100 on the muscimol site in the GABAA receptor, increasing the affinity for the radioligand by a factor of 10, and diminishing the efficiency of antagonists, is considered here in terms of structural changes in the receptor, induced by the action of the detergent on the membrane microenvironment."

Ramírez,Neurochemistry International,"The developmental profiles of the neurotransmitter recognition site, labeled by [3H]muscimol, and of the two main modulatory sites, labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam and [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate, respectively, within the GABAA receptor complex, have been determined in chick tectal lobes between embryonic day 8 and postnatal day 20. The consonance among the rates of appearance and accumulation of the three receptor sites in tectal membranes suggests a coordinated expression and assembly of the protein subunits involved in the spatial configuration of the complex and its three binding sites, although the existence of isolated muscimol binding subunits during early embryogenesis cannot be excluded at the present time. Furthermore, the total number of binding sites of each kind, per pair of lobes, is compatible with a 1/1/I stoichiometry. The GABAA receptor complex reaches a maximum of expression, relative to total membrane protein, immediately after hatching, suggesting that the tectal GABAergic system may be instrumental in damping the effects of sudden exposure to light of the chick visual system upon eye opening."

Paillard,Journal of Instrumentation,"The future upgrades of the LHC experiments will increase the beam luminosity leading to a corresponding growth of the amounts of data to be treated by the data acquisition systems. To address these needs, the GBT (Giga-Bit Transceiver optical link [1,2]) architecture was developed to provide the simultaneous transfer of readout data, timing and trigger signals as well as slow control and monitoring data. The GBT-SCA ASIC, part of the GBT chip-set, has the purpose to distribute control and monitoring signals to the on-detector front-end electronics and perform monitoring operations of detector environmental parameters. In order to meet the requirements of different front-end ASICs used in the experiments, it provides various user-configurable interfaces capable to perform simultaneous operations. It is designed employing radiation tolerant design techniques to ensure robustness against SEUs and TID radiation effects and is implemented in a commercial 130 nm CMOS technology.

Mignant,Experimental Astronomy,"The GraF instrument using a Fabry-Perot interferometer cross-dispersed with a grating was one of the first integral-field and long-slit spectrographs built for and used with an adaptive optics system. We describe its concept, design, optimal observational procedures and the measured performances. The instrument was used in 1997–2001 at the ESO3.6 m telescope equipped with ADONIS adaptive optics and SHARPII+camera. The operating spectral range was 1.2–2.5 μm. We used the spectral resolution from 500 to 10 000 combined with the angular resolution of 0.1″–0.2″. The quality of GraF data is illustrated by the integral field spectroscopy of the complex0.9″ × 0.9″ central region of η Car in the1.7 μm spectral range at the limit of spectral and angular resolutions."
780,The Impact of Business Strategies on Online Sustainability Disclosures,A. Amran;S. Ooi;R. Mydin;S. Devi,Business Strategy and the Environment,"With increasing attention being paid to corporate sustainability, pressure from stakeholders, especially customers, is forcing companies to implement sustainability strategies and practices that express their commitment to sustainable development, and engage with stakeholders through voluntary sustainability disclosure. To better understand the sustainability disclosure mechanisms from a business strategy perspective, this study investigates the influence of business strategy, formulated by customer groups, on online sustainability disclosure. It provides empirical observation of Malaysian public‐listed companies based on the combined lens of stakeholder and legitimacy theory. Despite the comparatively low level of corporate sustainability disclosure in Malaysia, this content analysis of online sustainability information disclosure reveals that the companies with more diversified product lines disclose more sustainability information, and that the corporate sustainability effort is significantly related to brand name. Hence, companies should be encouraged to proactively improve their sustainability performance and disclose more sustainability information in order to strengthen their brand names.

781,The Impact of Surgical Volume on Outcomes and Cost in Cleft Repair: A Kids' Inpatient Database Analysis,A. Bucknor;A. Chattha;W. Wu;S. Egeler;K. Ultee;S. Afshar;S. Lin,Annals of Plastic Surgery,"Background: Centralization of specialist services, including cleft service delivery, is occurring worldwide with the aim of improving the outcomes. This study examines the relationship between hospital surgical volume in cleft palate repair and outcomes. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the Kids' Inpatient Database was undertaken. Children 3 years or younger undergoing cleft palate repair in 2012 were identified. Hospital volume was categorized by cases per year as low volume (LV; 0–14), intermediate volume (IV; 15–46), or high volume (HV; 47–99); differences in complications, hospital costs, and length of stay (LOS) were determined by hospital volume. Results: Data for 2389 children were retrieved: 24.9% (n = 595) were LV, 50.1% (n = 1196) were IV, and 25.0% (n = 596) were HV. High-volume centers were more frequently located in the West (71.9%) compared with LV (19.9%) or IV (24.5%) centers ( P < 0.001 for hospital region). Median household income was more commonly highest quartile in HV centers compared with IV or LV centers (32.3% vs 21.7% vs 18.1%, P < 0.001). There was no difference in complications between different volume centers ( P = 0.74). Compared with HV centers, there was a significant decrease in mean costs for LV centers ($9682 vs $,378, P < 0.001) but no significant difference in cost for IV centers ($9260 vs $9682, P = 0.103). Both IV and LV centers had a significantly greater LOS when compared with HV centers (1.97 vs 2.10 vs 1.74, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Despite improvement in LOS in HV centers, we did not find a reduction in cost in HV centers. Further research is needed with analysis of outpatient, long-term outcomes to ensure widespread cost-efficiency."
782,The Influence of Governance Structure and Strategic Corporate Social Responsibility Toward Sustainability Reporting Quality,A. Amran;S. Lee;S. Devi,Business Strategy and the Environment,"Increased business complexities coupled with enhanced global transformation have propelled corporations to behave as responsible citizens to drive the sustainability agenda. Many corporations incorporate their affirmative commitment to sustainable business practices into their corporate identities and give evidence for this in their sustainability reports. This paper examines the role of the board of directors in sustainability reporting quality (SRQ) in the Asia‐Pacific region. Based on a cross‐sectional study of 113 companies from 12 countries in the region, we find that the SRQ in the region leaves much room for improvement. However, we find that the institutionalization of the concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in an organization provides a sound foundation for enhancing SRQ. We find that the value of CSR anchored in the vision and/ or mission statement and strategic alliances fostered with non‐governmental organizations are positively associated with SRQ."

784,The Lucretian swerve: The biological basis of human behavior and the criminal justice system,A. Cashmore,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) - Neuroscience,"It is widely believed, at least in scientific circles, that living systems, including mankind, obey the natural physical laws. However, it is also commonly accepted that man has the capacity to make “free” conscious decisions that do not simply reflect the chemical makeup of the individual at the time of decision—this chemical makeup reflecting both the genetic and environmental history and a degree of stochasticism. Whereas philosophers have discussed for centuries the apparent lack of a causal component for free will, many biologists still seem to be remarkably at ease with this notion of free will; and furthermore, our judicial system is based on such a belief. It is the author’s contention that a belief in free will is nothing other than a continuing belief in vitalism—something biologists proudly believe they discarded well over 100 years ago."
785,The Morality of Disordered Eating and Recovery in Southern Italy,A. Cheney;S. Sullivan;K. Grubbs,Medical Anthropology Quarterly,"Scholars have traced the processes through which moral subjectivities are constituted in culturally meaningful ways through eating disorders and recovery practices, demonstrating how subjective meanings of eating disorders and recovery from them are imbued with moral undertones and become meaningful ways of existing within specific historical and cultural contexts. Drawing on ethnographic insights and interviews with young women with disordered eating histories in southern Italy, we show how suffering from eating disorders and recovery from them enables women to retool their identities and craft moral selves. We draw attention to the value of medical anthropology in the care and comprehension of well‐being of girls and women suffering from disordered eating."
786,The Myths of Heaven-Sent Creativity: Toward a Perhaps Less Democratic But More Down-to-Earth Understanding,A. Cropley,Creativity Research Journal,"Creativity is surrounded by a cluster of long-held beliefs—referred to here as myths—which regard it as confined to aesthetic/spiritual domains and as a divine gift to a tiny few, and thus render it ineluctable, ineffable and inscrutable. As a result, treating it as part of normal psychological functioning and emphasizing its usefulness seems almost blasphemous, and is regarded by some as devaluing creative talent or even rendering the idea of creativity meaningless. Indeed, there really does seem to be a danger of commodifying creativity and reducing it to fast food creativity—attractively packaged but lacking genuine nutritional value. However, a phase model of the process of creativity makes it possible to distinguish between sublime creativity, mundane creativity, and commodified creativity without attributing the former to forces beyond mere human existence. This conceptualization has practical consequences for, for instance, education."
787,The National Solidarity Programme: Assessing the Effects of Community-Driven Development in Afghanistan,A. Beath;F. Christia;R. Enikolopov,International Peacekeeping,"Over the past two decades, community-based approaches to project delivery have become a popular means for governments and development agencies to improve the alignment of projects with the needs of rural communities and to increase the participation of villagers in project design and implementation. This article briefly summarizes the results of an impact evaluation of the National Solidarity Programme (NSP), a community-driven development programme in Afghanistan that created democratically-elected community development councils and funded small-scale development projects. Using a randomized controlled trial across 500 villages, the evaluation finds that NSP had a positive effect on access to drinking water and electricity, acceptance of democratic processes, perceptions of economic well-being and attitudes towards women. Effects on perceptions of local and national government performance and material economic outcomes were, however, more limited or short-lived."

Gröcke,"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology","During the Pliensbachian–Toarcian interval of the Early Jurassic, there is a well-known second order marine extinction that is observable at the species and genus levels. Ammonite diversity data from successions throughout Europe and parts of the Arctic suggest that this extinction may have been multi-phased with diversity declining over six separate intervals. The main-phase of decline begins at the Pliensbachian–Toarcian boundary and extends into the Lower Toarcian, to a level that is correlative with the Tenuicostatum/Serpentinum Zone boundary. To date, only the main-phase of extinction has been demonstrated as being global in extent and affecting multiple taxonomic groups. This multi-phased extinction has been attributed to regional and global controlling mechanisms that are associated with the Volcanic Greenhouse Scenario which links the eruption of the Karoo–Ferrar large igneous province (LIP) to global warming and mass extinction.We compare stratigraphic ranges of ammonite and foraminiferal species in Pliensbachian–Toarcian successions of western North America to the record in Europe and parts of the Arctic in order to test the geographic extent of the multiple phases of extinction. Our results show six intervals of species level decline that correlate with those recognized in Europe: 1) middle of the Lower Pliensbachian (middle Whiteavesi–middle Freboldi Zones), 2) middle of the Upper Pliensbachian (upper Kunae–lower Carlottense Zone), 3) Pliensbachian/Toarcian boundary into the Lower Toarcian (upper Carlottense–middle Kanense Zones), 4) Middle Toarcian (upper Planulata–lower Crassicosta Zones), 5) upper Middle–lower Upper Toarcian (middle Crassicosta–Hillebrandti Zones) and 6) Upper Toarcian (lower Yakounensis Zone).Recognition of this multi-phased event in three separate ocean basins (paleo Pacific, paleo Arctic, and Tethys Oceans), in at least two taxonomic groups, greatly expands the known geographic extent of this multi-phased event and argues for a controlling mechanism that is global in its reach. In relation to the Volcanic Greenhouse Scenario, our study shows that four of the six pulses of extinction occur within the main-phase of Karoo magmatism. The decline in the Early Pliensbachian, previously thought to be separate from this event, occurs within error range of the onset of Karoo magmatism and the decline in the Late Toarcian coincides with the later stages of magmatism. These observations extend the known duration of this multi-phased extinction event to the Early Pliensbachian and support the Volcanic Greenhouse Scenario, specifically the eruption of the Karoo–Ferrar LIP, as a preeminent factor driving the multi-phased extinction of the Pliensbachian–Toarcian.Duration of Pliensbachian–Toarcian extinction is analyzed in western North America.Species-level diversity data includes ammonoid and foraminiferal occurrences.Data shows six correlative phases of diversity decline in three ocean basins.Multiple correlative declines argue for global controls for all phases.Correlation in timing between multi-phased event and Karoo magmatism.During the Pliensbachian–Toarcian interval of the Early Jurassic, there is a well-known second order marine extinction that is observable at the species and genus levels.

789,The Propeptide Mediates Formation of Stromal Stores of PROMIC-1: Role in Determining Prostate Cancer Outcome,A. Bauskin;D. Brown;S. Junankar;K. Rasiah;S. Eggleton;M. Hunter;T. Liu;D. Smith;T. Kuffner;G. Pankhurst;H. Johnen;P. Russell;W. Barret;P. Stricker;J. Grygiel;J. Kench;S. Henshall;R. Sutherland;S. Breit,Cancer Research,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a reservoir of cellular binding proteins and growth factors that are critical for normal cell behavior, and aberrations in the ECM invariably accompany malignancies such as prostate cancer. Carcinomas commonly overexpress macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1), a proapoptotic and antitumorigenic transforming growth factor–β superfamily cytokine. Here we show that MIC-1 is often secreted in an unprocessed propeptide containing form. It is variably processed intracellularly, with unprocessed forms being secreted from several tumor lines, including prostate carcinoma lines, PC-3 and LNCaP. Once secreted, only unprocessed proMIC-1 binds ECM, demonstrating for the first time the occurrence of extracellular stores of MIC-1. The propeptide mediates this association via its COOH-terminal 89 amino acids. Xenograft models bearing tumors secreting various engineered forms of MIC-1 show that the propeptide regulates the balance between ECM stores and circulating serum levels of mature MIC-1 in vivo. The absence of propeptide results in ∼20-fold increase in serum MIC-1 levels. The significance of stromal MIC-1 stores was evaluated in prostate cancer tissue cores, which show major variation in stromal levels of MIC-1. Stromal MIC-1 levels are linked to prostate cancer outcome following radical prostatectomy, with decreasing stromal levels providing an important independent predictor of disease relapse. In low-grade localized prostate cancer (Gleason sum score ≤ 6), the level of MIC-1 stromal stores was the best predictor of future relapse when compared with all other clinicopathologic variables. The secretion and ECM association of unprocessed proMIC-1 is likely to play a central role in modulating local bioavailability of MIC-1 which can affect patient outcome in prostate cancer and other epithelial tumors."
790,The Role of Immunohistochemistry in Idiopathic Chronic Intestinal Pseudoobstruction (CIPO): A Case-control Study,A. Amiot;D. Cazals-Hatem;F. Joly;A. Lavergne-Slove;M. Peuchmaur;Y. Bouhnik;P. Bedossa;B. Messing,American Journal of Surgical Pathology,"Introduction: Chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (CIPO) is classified into enteric visceral myopathies, neuropathies, and/or mesenchymopathies. Although the histology usually permits to highlight pathologic abnormalities of CIPO, it fails in almost a third of cases. The yield of a systematic immunohistochemistry needs to be evaluating. Materials and Methods: Twenty-one adult patients with idiopathic CIPO [11 females/10 males, median age 23.1 (0.3 to 57) y] were included and compared with 27 control and 10 with mechanical obstruction patients. Comparison between standard histology (hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections) and systematic immunohistochemistry using muscular (smooth muscle α-actin, desmin, and smoothelin-A/B), nervous (Hu C/D, Bcl-2, and S100 protein), and mesenchymal ( CD117 ) markers was carried out. Results: Histology showed neuromuscular abnormalities in 13 out of 21 (62%) patients, consisting of enteric visceral myopathy in 9 (43%) patients, enteric visceral neuropathy in 2 (9.5%), and mixed neuromyopathy in 2 (9.5%). Among the 8 patients who had no histologic structural abnormality, 6 patients (75%) had underlying abnormalities detected with immunohistochemistry: immunostain with Hu C/D detected a hypoganglionosis (<50 ganglion cells /cm) in 6 out of 21 (29%) patients, 4 of them undiagnosed on standard histology; CD117 (c-kit) detected a interstitial cells of Cajal defect in 10 out of 21 (48%) patients, 2 of them with no histologic structural abnormality. Smoothelin-A/B and desmin were useless as normally expressed in all patients with no myopathy; although it was not relevant in ileal samples (86% of abnormal expression in control patients), smooth muscle α-actin showed an abnormal expression in 2 CIPO patients (2/21). Conclusions: Immunohistochemistry using Hu C/D and CD117 antibodies combined to the standard histology increased the yield of detection of neuromuscular abnormalities in idiopathic CIPO patients."
791,The Schinzel Hypothesis for Polynomials,A. Bodin;P. Dèbes;S. Najib,ArXiv Mathematics,"The Schinzel hypothesis is a famous conjectural statement about primes in value sets of polynomials, which generalizes the Dirichlet theorem about primes in an arithmetic progression. We consider the situation that the ring of integers is replaced by a polynomial ring and prove the Schinzel hypothesis for a wide class of them: polynomials in at least one variable over the integers, polynomials in several variables over an arbitrary field, etc. We achieve this goal by developing a version over rings of the Hilbert specialization property. A polynomial Goldbach conjecture is deduced, along with a result on spectra of rational functions."
792,The Solar-Stellar Connection,A. Brun;R. García;G. Houdek;D. Nandy;M. Pinsonneault,Space Science Reviews,"We discuss how recent advances in observations, theory and numerical simulations have allowed the stellar community to progress in its understanding of stellar convection, rotation and magnetism and to assess the degree to which the Sun and other stars share similar dynamical properties. Ensemble asteroseismology has become a reality with the advent of large time domain studies, especially from space missions. This new capability has provided improved constraints on stellar rotation and activity, over and above that obtained via traditional techniques such as spectropolarimetry or CaII H&K observations. New data and surveys covering large mass and age ranges have provided a wide parameter space to confront theories of stellar magnetism. These new empirical databases are complemented by theoretical advances and improved multi-D simulations of stellar dynamos. We trace these pathways through which a lucid and more detailed picture of magnetohydrodynamics of solar-like stars is beginning to emerge and discuss future prospects."

Pazo,Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology,"The aim of this review was to give a general aspect of the sensorial function of the striatum related to pain modulation, which was intensively studied in our laboratory. We analyse the effect of electrical and chemical stimulation of the striatum on the orofacial pain, especially that produced by tooth pulp stimulation of the lower incisors. We demonstrated specific sites within the nucleus which electrical or chemical stimulation produced inhibition of the nociceptive jaw opening reflex. This analgesic action of the striatum was mediated by activation of its dopamine D2 receptors and transmitted through the indirect pathways of the basal ganglia and the medullary dorsal reticular nucleus (RVM) to the sensorial nuclei of the trigeminal nerve. Its mechanism of action was by inhibition of the nociceptive response of the second order neurons of the nucleus caudalis of the V par."

796,"The TD Wheel: A heuristic to shape, support and evaluate transdisciplinary research",A. Carew;F. Wickson,Futures,"Transdisciplinary approaches to research are increasingly touted for the messy social and environmental problems of our time. Such problems transcend disciplinary boundaries, are intertwined with sociopolitical context, and require participation of stakeholders to generate socially acceptable outcomes. A substantial barrier to transdisciplinary (TD) research is devising and applying evaluative criteria or schemas for an approach that is recognized as necessarily tailored, flexible and evolving. This paper addresses the challenge of shaping, supporting and evaluating transdisciplinary research. Firstly, we synthesise the literature on TD research characteristics, highlighting areas of emerging consensus and some implications of these for research design, execution and quality evaluation. Secondly, we present an adaptable heuristic called the TD Wheel (TDW). The TDW is a synthesis of the disparate insights available within the current literature, and is presented as an organizing graphic for TD research. We explain how the TDW has utility at three stages of the research process: shaping (planning and proposing research); supporting (guiding research in-train); and evaluating (planning for evaluation, periodically documenting/checking progress, and reporting on outcomes). The TDW is a provocative graphic geared to help researchers visualize and discuss the elements and process of TD research.Transdisciplinary approaches to research are increasingly touted for the messy social and environmental problems of our time.

798,The Validity of Consumption Data: Are the Consumer Expenditure Interview and Diary Surveys Informative?,A. Bee;B. Meyer;J. Sullivan,NBER Working Papers,"This paper examines the quality of data collected in the Consumer Expenditure (CE) Survey, which is the source for the Consumer Price Index weights and is the main source of U.S. consumption microdata. We compare reported spending on a large number of categories of goods and services to comparable national income account data. We do this separately for the two components of the CE--the Interview Survey and the Diary Survey--rather than a combination that has been used in past comparisons. We find that most of the largest categories of consumption are measured well in the Interview Survey as the ratio to the national account data is close to one and has not declined appreciably over time. Several other large categories are reported at a low rate or have seen the ratio to the national accounts decline over time. The results are less encouraging for the Diary Survey. There is no large Diary category that is both measured well and reported at a higher rate than in the Interview Survey. We also compare the ownership of and the value of durables, such as homes and cars, in the CE to other sources. This evidence suggests the CE performs fairly well. Based on observable characteristics, the CE Survey appears to be fairly representative, although there is strong evidence of under-representation at the top of the income distribution and under-reporting of income and expenditures at the top. We then examine the precision of the two surveys and the frequency of no spending overall or for a given spending category. In the Diary Survey, we find much greater dispersion in spending and the dispersion relative to the Interview Survey varies across goods and over time. Diary respondents are much more likely to report zero spending for a consumption category, and a high and increasing fraction of respondents reporting zero for all categories. These results suggest that using Diary data to assess inequality trends and other distributional outcomes is likely to lead to biased and misleading results. Our results have important implications for interpreting and properly using CE data and how best to redesign the CE."
799,The behavior of umami components in thermally treated yeast extract,A. Alim;C. Yang;H. Song;Y. Liu;S. Zhang,Food Research International,"Umami proteolytics are natural food flavor alternatives to glutamate. In this study, key umami taste fractions were separated and purified from thermally treated yeast extract (YE) to yield fifteen umami peptides. Systematic approaches using sensory-guided fractionation on taste-active umami proteolytics separation and detection were utilized. A reaction temperature of 110 °C was optimum for umami peptide generation. Under this reaction temperature, the sensory score and E-tongue results of umami taste were the highest. The sensory evaluation-based taste dilution analysis and taste threshold determination supported the hypothesis that umami peptides have their physiological effect by binding to G-protein coupled receptors. The structural differences of umami peptides contribute to their taste profile and allow categorization into two group Types. Fifteen umami peptides were then categorized into Type I and Type II regarding the contractual-based taste mechanism: Type I peptides imparted complex tastes. The tastes of Type I peptides could split into two stages: bitterness and umami in pure water, whereas, Type II peptides presented strong umami taste at a high concentration in pure water, and the relationship between umami capacity and peptides concentration was linear. Finally, the guidance of the umami peptide usage in the flavor industry has been established according to broths dissolution test."
800,The behavioral dyscontrol scale in the differential diagnosis of behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer disease,A. Alsemari;P. Malloy,Clinical Neuropsychologist,"Objective: The Behavioral Dyscontrol Scale (BDS) is a brief measure of frontal systems that is adopted from Luria’s syndrome analysis approach. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of the BDS as an objective measure of self-regulation in behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).Methods: Two patient groups matched in education and dementia severity (n = 21 bvFTD and 21 AD) recruited from a memory clinic and a matched normal control (NC) group (n = 21) were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests including the BDS.Results: ROC analyses revealed that performance on the BDS discriminated between the bvFTD group and the AD and NC groups, as well as between AD and NC groups. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis showed that the majority of the variance in BDS performance was explained by executive tests.Conclusions: the BDS has good psychometric prosperities; is easy to administer and score; is well tolerated by geriatric patients; and is useful diagnostically for discriminating bvFTD from AD, yielding good to excellent sensitivity and specificity values."
801,The biotechnological potential of marine bacteria in the novel lineage of Pseudomonas pertucinogena,A. Bollinger;S. Thies;N. Katzke;K. Jaeger,Microbial Biotechnology,"Summary Marine habitats represent a prolific source for molecules of biotechnological interest. In particular, marine bacteria have attracted attention and were successfully exploited for industrial applications. Recently, a group of Pseudomonas species isolated from extreme habitats or living in association with algae or sponges were clustered in the newly established Pseudomonas pertucinogena lineage. Remarkably for the predominantly terrestrial genus Pseudomonas, more than half (9) of currently 16 species within this lineage were isolated from marine or saline habitats. Unlike other Pseudomonas species, they seem to have in common a highly specialized metabolism. Furthermore, the marine members apparently possess the capacity to produce biomolecules of biotechnological interest (e.g. dehalogenases, polyester hydrolases, transaminases). Here, we summarize the knowledge regarding the enzymatic endowment of the marine Pseudomonas pertucinogena bacteria and report on a genomic analysis focusing on the presence of genes encoding esterases, dehalogenases, transaminases and secondary metabolites including carbon storage compounds."

Aniline was found to be the only product formed through a reaction consuming six moles of thiophenol for each mol of aniline produced. The kinetics of the system have been analyzed in detail. In excess of thiophenol, all reactions follow first‐order kinetics (ln([PhNO2]/[PhNO2]0) = −kappt) with the apparent rate constant kapp being a complex function of both initial nitrobenzene and thiophenol concentrations, as well as linearly dependent on the amount of solid catalyst used. A mechanism for this catalytic reaction consistent with the kinetic experiments as well as the observed properties of the intercalated molybdenum complex has thiophenol inducing the initial coupled proton–electron transfer steps to form an intercalated MoIV species, which is oxidized back to the parent MoVI complex by nitrobenzene via a two‐electron oxygen atom transfer reaction that yields nitrosobenzene. This mechanism is widespread in enzymatic catalysis and in model chemical reactions. The intermediate nitrosobenzene thus formed is reduced directly by excess thiophenol to aniline. The values of rate coefficients indicate that reduction of nitrobenzene proceeds much faster than proton‐assisted oxidation of thiophenol. This may account for the observation that the presence of protonic amberlite IR‐120(H) increases considerably the rate of the overall reaction catalyzed. Activation parameters in excess of the protonic resin and PhSH were ΔH≠ = 80 kJ mol−1 and ΔS≠ = −70 J mol−1 K−1. The large negative activation entropy is consistent with an associative transition state. The present system is characterized by a well‐defined catalytic cycle with multiple‐turnovers reductions of nitrobenzene to aniline without appreciable deactivation. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

803,"The challenging integration of platinum compounds, taxanes, and molecular-targeted therapies in the multidisciplinary treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck",A. Awada;G. Ismael,Current Opinion in Oncology,"There have been important advances in the treatment of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). For patients with unresectable disease, the use of platinum-based chemoradiotherapy has improved the 3-year survival rate from 15–20% to 35–50%. The results of recent studies involving sequential therapy of induction chemotherapy including taxanes and chemoradiation have shown encouraging survival rates, near to 60–70%. Moreover, progress in the understanding of the molecular changes that lead to the development of these tumors is bringing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches into clinical practice, promising new hope to patients with a devastating and lethal disease."
804,The characteristics of subject matter in different academic areas.,A. Biglan,Journal of Applied Psychology,"Performed multidimensional scaling on scholars' judgments about the similarities of the subject-matter of different academic areas. 168 university scholars made judgments about 36 areas, and 54 small-college scholars judged similarities among 30 areas. G. A. Miller's method of sorting was used in collecting data. 3 dimensions were common to the solutions of both samples: existence of a paradigm, concern with application, and concern with life systems. It appears that these dimensions are general to the subject-matter of most academic institutions."
805,The cost of diabetes in Latin America and the Caribbean.,A. Barceló;C. Aedo;S. Rajpathak;S. Robles,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,"OBJECTIVE: To measure the economic burden associated with diabetes mellitus in Latin America and the Caribbean. METHODS: Prevalence estimates of diabetes for the year 2000 were used to calculated direct and indirect costs of diabetes mellitus. Direct costs included costs due to drugs, hospitalizations, consultations and management of complications. The human capital approach was used to calculate indirect costs and included calculations of forgone earnings due to premature mortality and disability attributed to diabetes mellitus. Mortality and disability attributed to causes other than diabetes were subtracted from estimates to consider only the excess burden due to diabetes. A 3% discount rate was used to convert future earnings to current value. FINDINGS: The annual number of deaths in 2000 caused by diabetes mellitus was estimated at 339,035. This represented a loss of 757,096 discounted years of productive life among persons younger than 65 years (> billion US dollars). Permanent disability caused a loss of 12,699,087 years and over 50 billion US dollars, and temporary disability caused a loss of 136,701 years in the working population and over 763 million US dollars. Costs associated with insulin and oral medications were 4720 million US dollars, hospitalizations 1012 million US dollars, consultations 2508 million US dollars and care for complications 2,480 million US dollars. The total annual cost associated with diabetes was estimated as 65,216 million US dollars (direct 10,721 US dollars; indirect 54,496 US dollars). CONCLUSION: Despite limitations of the data, diabetes imposes a high economic burden to individuals and society in all countries and to Latin American and the Caribbean as whole."
806,The critical role of nurturing environments for promoting human well-being.,A. Biglan;B. Flay;D. Embry;I. Sandler,American Psychologist,"The recent Institute of Medicine report on prevention (National Research Council & Institute of Medicine, 2009) noted the substantial interrelationship among mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders and pointed out that, to a great extent, these problems stem from a set of common conditions. However, despite the evidence, current research and practice continue to deal with the prevention of mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders as if they are unrelated and each stems from different conditions. This article proposes a framework that could accelerate progress in preventing these problems. Environments that foster successful development and prevent the development of psychological and behavioral problems are usefully characterized as nurturing environments. First, these environments minimize biologically and psychologically toxic events. Second, they teach, promote, and richly reinforce prosocial behavior, including self-regulatory behaviors and all of the skills needed to become productive adult members of society. Third, they monitor and limit opportunities for problem behavior. Fourth, they foster psychological flexibility—the ability to be mindful of one's thoughts and feelings and to act in the service of one's values even when one's thoughts and feelings discourage taking valued action. We review evidence to support this synthesis and describe the kind of public health movement that could increase the prevalence of nurturing environments and thereby contribute to the prevention of most mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders. This article is one of three in a special section (see also Muñoz Beardslee, & Leykin, 2012; Yoshikawa, Aber, & Beardslee, 2012) representing an elaboration on a theme for prevention science developed by the 2009 report of the National Research Council and Institute of Medicine."

808,The deposition of NbN and NbC thin films by filtered vacuum cathodic arc deposition,A. Bendavid;P. Martin;T. Kinder;E. Preston,Surface and Coatings Technology,"Thin films of niobium nitride (NbN) and niobium carbide (NbC) have been deposited onto conducting (1 0 0) silicon wafers by a filtered vacuum cathodic arc system. The influences of the depositing Nb+ energy, nitrogen and methane pressure on the composition structure and mechanical properties have been investigated. The X-ray diffraction data showed that with increasing substrate bias and gas partial pressure there is an increase in the preferred orientation. Both NbN and NbC films were stoichiometric with no detectable change with increasing substrate bias at the working pressure used. The hardness of both types of films was found to saturate at a substrate bias of approximately −100 V and a partial pressure of nitrogen or methane of 0.65 Pa. The maximum hardness was found to be 48.5 and 45 GPa for NbN and NbC, respectively. The compressive stress was found to increase with increasing substrate bias. The compressive stress ranged between 3.0–8.5 GPa for NbN and 2.0–4.5 GPa for NbC. Strong correlation between compressive stress and hardness was observed for both materials.Thin films of niobium nitride (NbN) and niobium carbide (NbC) have been deposited onto conducting (1 0 0) silicon wafers by a filtered vacuum cathodic arc system.

809,The detoxification effect of liquid digestate on vanadium toxicity to seed germination and seedling growth of dog's tail grass,A. Aihemaiti;J. Jiang;L. Blaney;Q. Zou;Y. Xu,Journal of Hazardous Materials,"Dog’s tail grass (Setaria viridis) presented strong tolerance and high accumulation of vanadium in field conditions. Liquid digestate containing high levels of nutrients could alleviate vanadium toxicity and accelerate the growth of dog’s tail grass. To elucidate the detoxification potential and mechanism of liquid digestate, dog’s tail grass was grown in soil solution containing 0.14–55.8 mg L-1 of vanadium. Parameters including germination index (GI), tolerance index (TI), seedlings’ fresh weight, seedlings’ vanadium accumulation, antioxidant enzymes activity, malonaldehyde (MDA) content, and V5+ species, were measured after addition of 1%, 5%, 10% and 15% liquid digestate. The results showed that a vanadium level of 10.9 mg L-1was a threshold value for toxicity; furthermore, the GI and TI decreased by 50% when vanadium content reached 36.8 mg L-1. The MDA content was reduced, and the other parameters were markedly enhanced, after addition of 5% and 10% liquid digestate with vanadium levels above 36.8 mg L-1. V5+ species was the dominant vanadium species in solution and the addition of liquid digestate reduced V5+ concentrations. The detoxification of vanadium by liquid digestate was a combined effect of direct reduction of V5+ species and plant nutrition."
810,The development and evaluation of an evidence-based guideline programme to improve care in a paediatric emergency department,A. Akenroye;A. Stack,Emergency Medicine Journal,"Introduction Care guidelines can improve the quality of care by making current evidence available in a concise format. Emergency departments (EDs) are an ideal site for guidelines given the wide variety of presenting conditions and treating providers, and the need for timely decision making. We designed a programme for guideline development and implementation and evaluated its impact in an ED.Methods The setting was an urban paediatric ED with an annual volume of 60 000. Common and/or high-risk conditions were identified for guideline development. Following implementation of the guidelines, their impact on effectiveness of care, patient outcomes, efficiency and equitability of care was assessed using a web-based provider survey and performance on identified metrics. Variation in clinical care between providers was assessed using funnel plots.Results Eleven (11) guidelines were developed and implemented. 3 years after the initiation of the programme, self-reported adherence to recommendations was high (95% for physicians and 89% for nurses). 97% of physicians and 92% of nurses stated that the programme improved the quality of care in the ED. For some guidelines, provider-to-provider care practice variation was reduced significantly. We found reduced disparity in imaging when assessing one guideline. There were also reductions in utilisation of diagnostic tests or therapies. As a balancing measure, the percentage of patients with any of the guideline conditions who returned to the ED within 72 h of discharge did not change from before to after guideline initiation. Overall, 80% of physician and 56% of nurse respondents rated the guideline programme at the highest value.Conclusions A programme for guideline development and implementation helped to improve efficiency, and standardise and eliminate disparities in emergency care without jeopardising patient outcomes."
811,The development of market power in the Spanish power generation sector: Perspectives after market liberalization,A. Ciarreta;S. Nasirov;C.

812,The devil is in the details: investigating the influence of emotion on event memory using a simulated event,A. Congleton;D. Berntsen,Psychological Research,"In our everyday lives, the negative events we experience sometimes include powerful, salient details which are ultimately responsible for us interpreting the events as negative (i.e., they drive our interpretation of the emotional valence of the event). Here we examined how the presence of such details within an event shapes our memory of that event. Research on the role of emotion in memory suggests that negative events are often remembered more accurately than positive ones, and this advantage is especially pronounced for the emotion-defining details of the events. However, research rarely separates retrieval effects from effects of attention and information processing during encoding. Here we used a simulated event to examine (1) whether negative events are remembered more accurately than positive events, (2) whether this effect is more pronounced for the emotion-defining detail of the event, (3) whether participants display enhanced accuracy for all aspects of an event (i.e., general memory enhancement) or for only certain aspects of the event (i.e., selective memory enhancement), and (4) whether any enhancement effects for central aspects of the event occur at the expense of contextual information (i.e., memory narrowing). Across three experiments, participants showed superior memory accuracy for the central details of the event in general, while those who interpreted the event as emotionally negative also displayed selective enhancement of the peripheral details. The results further suggested that it was the unexpectedness and/or salience introduced by the emotion-defining detail that was essential to enhancing memory accuracy, and not its goal relevance."
813,The effect of heat treatment on the properties of electrodeposited Ni-Mo coatings,A. Bigos;M. Janusz-Skuza;M. Szczerba;M. Kot;E. Beltowska-Lehman,Journal of Materials Processing Technology,"Nanocrystalline Ni-Mo (16 wt% of Mo) coatings electrodeposited on steel substrates from citrate electrolyte solution were annealed in argon atmosphere, in the temperature range from 300 to 800 ˚C. The effect of the heat treatment on the coatings’ microstructure (surface morphology, phase composition and grain size), as well as their mechanical, tribological and corrosion properties was determined. It was found that, up to 500 °C, the average crystallite size remains almost unchanged, but relaxation of grain boundaries leads to significant increase of the coatings’ microhardness (up to 1190 HV). For Ni-Mo alloys annealed at 500 °C, the wear index and friction coefficient increase significantly from 33·10-6 mm3/Nm and 0.4 (for as-deposited samples) to 89·10-6 mm3/Nm and 0.68. Above 500 °C, thermally-induced gradual fluctuations of chemical composition in the Ni-Mo alloy, and interdiffusion of iron (from the substrate) and nickel (from the coating), were observed. The segregation of elements promotes an increase of grain size (from 10 nm to 33 nm for as-deposited and annealed at 800 °C Ni-Mo coatings, respectively) resulting in decreased microhardness to 487 HV. However, the coatings become less stiff (EIT up to 205 GPa) and are characterised by enhancement of wear (Wv about 2.2-7.8⋅10-6 mm3/Nm) and friction resistance (about 0.4-0.5). No significant influence of the heat treatment temperature on the corrosion parameters of the coatings in the sulphate environment was found. The corrosion resistance of the Ni-Mo coating annealed at 800 °C decreased slightly (Icorr=5.9 µA/cm2, Rp =1530 Ω) in comparison to the as-deposited alloy (Icorr=4.8 µA/cm2, Rp=2430 Ω) and that annealed at 500 °C (Icorr=4.7 µA/cm2, Rp=2220 Ω)."
814,The effect of vanadium on essential element uptake of Setaria viridis' seedlings,A. Aihemaiti;J. Jiang;Y. Gao;Y. Meng;T. Tuerhong,Journal of Environmental Management,"High concentrations of vanadium, a ubiquitous element in the environment, in growing media leads to deformation of root structure and leaf chlorosis and necrosis, consequently affecting the translocations of nutrients and essential elements. However, the effects of vanadium on essential element uptake, and the interactions of essential elements in the presence of vanadium, remain incompletely understood. To elucidate the effects of different concentrations of vanadium on major and trace essential elements and plant growth, a native plant species growing in a vanadium mining area, Setaria viridis (dog tail's grass), was incubated in solutions containing 0–55.8 mg/L vanadium. The shoot accumulation of four major essential elements and five trace essential elements was detected, and the root length and stem height were measured. The results showed that vanadium in soil solution enhanced the accumulation of all major essential elements in shoot. Vanadium concentrations lower than 47.4 mg/L showed an obvious positive (p &lt; 0.05) effect on P accumulation and translocation. In the case of trace essential elements, there were threshold values for solution vanadium stimulation of element uptake. The threshold values for Cu and Zn, Fe, and Mo uptake were 4.3, 16.3, and 40.6 mg/L, respectively. When vanadium levels surpassed these values, accumulation was suppressed and the solution vanadium concentrations attenuated the solution-to-shoot translocation of most of the essential elements. Among the trace essential elements, translocation of Fe was obviously enhanced (p &lt; 0.05) by vanadium. Solution vanadium also enhanced plant growth at lower concentrations and inhibited it at higher levels. The threshold values for stem height and root length were 36.8 and 16.3 mg/L, respectively. Concentrations of 40 and 55.8 mg/L vanadium in soil solution caused a 50% decrease in root length and stem height, respectively, showing that root length of Setaria viridis is more susceptible to vanadium toxicity than stem growth."
815,"The effects of mountain grazing abandonment on plant community, forage value and soil properties: observations and field measurements in an alpine area",A. Cislaghi;L. Giupponi;A. Tamburini;A. Giorgi;G. Bischetti,Catena,"Progressive abandonment of pastoral activities, a common phenomenon in most mountainous economically developed areas worldwide, has been causing continuous land-use changes and inducing rapid ecological succession. Pastures are being abandoned, degraded, reforested, or disturbed by natural events. This study aims to investigate the effects of such change from different perspectives: from plant community and forage value changes, to differences in soil properties and soil stability indicators. Phytosociological relevés, forage quality analyses and field measurements of soil properties were carried out in 7 different study sites characterized by different grazing intensity (abandoned/under-grazed, moderately grazed, heavy grazed) and environmental conditions (disturbed by hillslope processes or reforested). Results showed significant discrepancies in terms of soil stabilization and ecological aspects. In particular, an increase in soil stabilization occurred where larches (Larix decidua) recolonized the completely abandoned pastures, whereas a decrease was observed in under-grazed pastures. In both cases, forage composition showed impoverished nutritional value for grazing animals. Conversely, an excellent balance between ecological advantages and contribution to soil engineering properties by roots was provided by the moderately grazed areas, mainly covered by Deschampsia cespitosa. This highlights how pasturing facilitates environmental conservation and combats natural processes such as soil erosion and shallow instabilities."

Mcstephen,Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society,"Performance on many cognitive and neuropsychological testsmay be improved by prior exposure to testing stimuli andprocedures. These beneficial practice effects can have asignificant impact on test performance when conventionalneuropsychological tests are administered at test–retestintervals of weeks, months or years. Many recent investigationshave sought to determine changes in cognitive function overperiods of minutes or hours (e.g., before and after anesthesia)using computerized tests. However, the effects of practice atsuch brief test–retest intervals has not been reported.The current study sought to determine the magnitude of practiceeffects in a group of 113 individuals assessed with an automatedcognitive test battery on 4 occasions in 1 day. Practice effectswere evident both between and within assessments, and also withinindividual tests. However, these effects occurred mostly betweenthe 1st and 2nd administration of the test battery, with smaller,nonsignificant improvements observed between the 2nd, 3rd, and4th administrations. On the basis of these results, methodologicaland statistical strategies that may aid in the differentiationof practice effects from drug-induced cognitive changes areproposed.

Cannell,Journal of Experimental Biology,"An engineering examination of allometric and analogical data on the flight of giant Permian insects (Protodonata, Meganeura or griffinflies) indicates that previous estimates of the body mass of these insects are too low and that the largest of these insects (wingspan of 70 cm or more) would have had a mass of 100–150 g, several times greater than previously thought. Here, the power needed to generate lift and fly at the speeds typical of modern large dragonflies is examined together with the metabolic rate and subsequent heat generated by the thoracic muscles. This evaluation agrees with previous work suggesting that the larger specimens would rapidly overheat in the high ambient temperatures assumed in the Permian. Various extant mechanisms of thermoregulation are modelled and quantified, including behaviour, radiation and the constraints on convective respiration and evaporation imposed by air flow through spiracles. However, the effects of these on cooling an overheated insect are found to be limited. Instead, an examination of the heat budget in the flight medium indicates that, at about 1.6 bar (160 kPa), thermoregulation supply enters into equilibrium and, even at high ambient temperatures, overheating can be avoided and enough oxygen sourced. This approach indicates how fossil biology can be used to examine past atmospheres."
819,The ethics of a formula: Calculating a financial–humanitarian price for water,A. Ballestero,American Ethnologist,"When Costa Rican regulators set water rates, they effectively transform the human right to water into a price. I propose the notion of a “calculation grammar” to grasp the inventive patterns and vibrant social engagements that fuse the ethical investments, ontological assumptions, and quantified expressions involved in this process. This grammar governs the relative weights and proportions of the elements in numeric propositions, giving them distinct meanings and political valences. The liveliness of these propositions derives from the power of numeric techniques in their inevitably place‐specific expressions as well as from the legal principles of sociality that enable them. I follow the mathematical formula regulators use to set water prices to reveal the inconspicuous financialization of human rights and the humanitarization of finance as they currently unfold across technocratic centers of calculation. I also argue for an ethnographic approach that remains committed to the ontological indivisibility of the technical and the cultural in any quantification effort.

Francisco,Acta Astronautica,"The International Rosetta Mission was launched on 2nd March 2004 on its 10 year journey to rendezvous with comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Rosetta performed comet orbit insertion on the 6th of August 2014, after which it characterised the nucleus and orbited it at altitudes as low as a few kilometres. In November 2014 Rosetta delivered the lander Philae to perform the first soft landing ever on the surface of a comet. After this critical operation, Rosetta began the escort phase of the comet in its journey in the Solar System heading to the perihelion, reached in August 2015. Originally foreseen till the end of 2015, the mission was extended for another nine months to follow the comet on its outbound arc of the orbit. In view of the acquired experience and of the approaching end of mission the spacecraft was flown at much closer distances from the nucleus so that the scientific instruments had the chance to perform unique measurements. Following this phase of very close orbits, on the 30th of September 2016 Rosetta was set on a collision course trajectory with the comet to terminate the mission with a controlled impact.This paper describes the details of the extended mission phase and the issues encountered during these months. It also includes the changes implemented on the spacecraft and in the operations concept to optimise the remaining mission time. The paper also includes the lessons learned from this unique and complex mission phase."

While justified by the risk of a national debt default, present fiscal policies might increase inequalities in access to care, deteriorate overall health indicators and population wellbeing, and sharpen existing difference in the quality of care between regions. Preliminary evidence shows that the crisis is affecting the quality of nutrition and the incidence of psychiatric disorders. During this difficult financial situation Italy is also facing the risk of a major reduction in investments for preventive medicine, Evidence Based Medicine infrastructures, health information systems and physical capital renewal. This cost-cutting strategy may have negative long term consequences Also, important achievement in terms of limiting waiting lists, improving continuity of care and patients’ centeredness, and promoting integration between social and health care may be negatively affected by unprecedented resources’ cuts. It is essential that in such a period of public funding constraints health authorities monitor incidence of diseases and access to care of the most vulnerable groups and specifically target interventions to those who may be disproportionally hit by the crisis."
823,The financial impact and drivers of hospital charges in contralateral prophylactic mastectomy and reconstruction: a Nationwide Inpatient Sample hospital analysis,A. Bucknor;A. Chattha;K. Ultee;W. Wu;P. Kamali;P. Bletsis;A. Chen;B. Lee;C. Cronin;S. Lin,Breast Cancer Research and Treatment,"Purpose Rates of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) have increased over the last decade; it is important for surgeons and hospital systems to understand the economic drivers of increased costs in these patients. This study aims to identify factors affecting charges in those undergoing CPM and reconstruction. Methods Analysis of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample was undertaken (2009–2012), identifying women aged ≥18 with unilateral breast cancer undergoing unilateral mastectomy with CPM and immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) (CPM group), in addition to unilateral mastectomy and IBR alone (UM group). Generalized linear modeling with gamma regression and a log-link function provided mean marginal hospital charge (MMHC) estimates associated with the presence or absence of patient, hospital and operative characteristics, postoperative complications, and length of stay (LOS). Results Overall, 70,695 women underwent mastectomy and reconstruction for unilateral breast cancer; 36,691 (51.9%) in the CPM group, incurring additional MMHCs of $20,775 compared to those in the UM group ( p < 0.001). In the CPM group, MMHCs were reduced in those aged >60 years ( p < 0.001), while African American or Hispanic origin increased MMHCs ( p < 0.001). Diabetes, depression, and obesity increased MMHCs ( p < 0.001). MMHCs increased with larger ( p < 0.001) hospitals, Western location ( p < 0.001), greater household income ( p < 0.001), complications ( p < 0.001), and increasing LOS ( p < 0.001). MMHCs decreased in urban teaching hospitals and Midwest or Southern regions ( p < 0.001). Conclusion There are many patient and hospital factors affecting charges; this study provides surgeons and hospital systems with transparent, quantitative charge data in patients undergoing contralateral prophylactic mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction."
824,The first fossil rove beetle from the middle Eocene Kishenehn Formation (North America) provides evidence for ancient Eocene relicts within the hyperdiverse Staphylinini (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Staphylininae),A. Brunke;H. Schillhammer;S. Chatzimanolis,Journal of Systematic Palaeontology,"A new rove beetle (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) is described from the middle Eocene Kishenehn Formation in Montana, USA. Tympanophorus greenwalti Chatzimanolis, Brunke & Schillhammer sp. nov. is the oldest known definitive member of the subtribe Anisolinina (Staphylininae: Staphylinini) and the entire Staphylinini propria clade, which contains the majority of the tribe's over 5500 described extant species. In order to provide robust justification for the systematic placement of the Kishenehn fossil, all genera of the Tympanophorus lineage are reviewed and redefined. A key to these genera is provided for the first time. Paratympanophorus Lecoq becomes a junior synonym of Trigonopalpus Cameron, with the following new combinations: Trigonopalpus africanus (Lecoq), Tr. peyrierasi (Lecoq), Tr. pubescens (Lecoq), Tr. punctatus (Lecoq) and Tr. steineri (Lecoq). Tympanophorus schenklingi Bernhauer is moved to Trigonopalpus (comb. nov.) and Ty. clavicornis (Lecoq) is moved to Barygnathus (comb. nov.), and thus, the genus Tympanophorus no longer occurs in the Afrotropical region. Tympanophorus is shown to be at least as old as the middle Eocene, and its disjunct New and Old World lineages are hypothesized to have been separated in the early Eocene.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:CA1993B8-1251-45C3-877E-C4604F78E781"

Fonseca;D. Pearson;B. Kjarsgaard,Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta,"We report detailed petrographic investigations along with 187Os/188Os data in Base Metal Sulfide (BMS) on four cratonic mantle xenoliths from Somerset Island (Rae Craton, Canada). The results shed light on the processes affecting the Re-Os systematics and provide time constraints on the formation and evolution of the cratonic lithospheric mantle beneath the Rae craton.When devoid of alteration, BMS grains mainly consist of pentlandite + pyrrhotite ± chalcopyrite. The relatively high BMS modal abundance of the four investigated xenoliths cannot be reconciled with the residual nature of these peridotites, but requires addition of metasomatic BMS. This is especially evident in the two peridotites with the highest bulk Pd/Ir and Pd/Pt. Metasomatic BMS likely formed during melt/fluid percolation in the Sub Continental Lithospheric Mantle (SCLM) as well as during infiltration of the host kimberlite magma, when djerfisherite crystallized around older Fe-Ni-sulfides. On the whole-rock scale, kimberlite metasomatism is visible in a subset of bulk xenoliths, which defines a Re-Os errorchron that dates the host magma emplacement.The 187Os/188Os measured in the twenty analysed BMS grains vary from 0.1084 to &gt;0.17 and it shows no systematic variation depending on the sulfide mineralogical assemblage. The largest range in 187Os/188Os is observed in BMS grains from the two xenoliths with the highest Pd/Ir, Pd/Pt, and sulfide modal abundance. The whole-rock TRD ages of these two samples underestimate the melting age obtained from BMS, demonstrating that bulk Re-Os model ages from peridotites with clear evidence of metasomatism should be treated with caution.The TRD ages determined in BMS grains are clustered around 2.8–2.7, ∼2.2 and ∼1.9 Ga. The 2.8–2.7 Ga TRD ages document the main SCLM building event in the Rae craton, which is likely related to the formation of the local greenstone belts in a continental rift setting. The Paleoproterozoic TRD ages can be explained by addition of metasomatic BMS during (i) major lithospheric rifting at ∼2.2 Ga and (ii) the Taltson-Thelon orogeny at ∼1.9 Ga. The data suggest that even metasomatic BMS can inherit 187Os/188Os from their original mantle source. The lack of isotopic equilibration, even at the micro-scale, allowed the preservation of different populations of BMS grains with distinct 187Os/188Os, providing age information on multiple magmatic events that affected the SCLM.We report detailed petrographic investigations along with 187Os/188Os data in Base Metal Sulfide (BMS) on four cratonic mantle xenoliths from Somerset Island (Rae Craton, Canada).

827,The growth of the loosening zone,A. Balueva,International Journal of Fracture,"The problem of fracture of rocks will be considered on the base of the kinetic mechanism. Namely, the method proposed will be based on statistical consideration of the accumulation of microfractures. In this paper, based on this concept, we will model massive fractures in rock mass around the borehole as the result of pumping the viscous fluid through this borehole into rock. The experiments have shown that, as the result of the pumping and depending on the properties of rocks, either a hydraulic fracture or a loosening zone spreads in rocks surrounding the borehole. We propose a simple qualitative model to describe how a loosening zone grows with time and to evaluate the parameters controlling this growth. We expect that the model proposed will help to predict the external parameters and rock properties for which one or another mechanism of hydraulic fracturing occurs (the hydraulic fracture or the loosening zone)."
828,The impact of drugs of abuse on executive function: characterizing long-term changes in neural correlates following chronic drug exposure and withdrawal in rats,A. Brockett;H. Pribut;D. Vázquez;M. Roesch,Learning and Memory,"Addiction has long been characterized by diminished executive function, control, and impulsivity management. In particular, these deficits often manifest themselves as impairments in reversal learning, delay discounting, and response inhibition. Understanding the neurobiological substrates of these behavioral deficits is of paramount importance to our understanding of addiction. Within the cycle of addiction, periods during and after withdrawal represent a particularly difficult point of intervention in that the negative physical symptoms associated with drug removal and drug craving increase the likelihood that the patient will relapse and return to drug use in order to abate these symptoms. Moreover, it is often during this time that drug induced deficits in executive function hinder the ability of the patient to refrain from drug use. Thus, it is necessary to understand the physiological and behavioral changes associated with withdrawal and drug craving—largely manifesting as deficits in executive control—to develop more effective treatment strategies. In this review, we address the long-term impact that drugs of abuse have on the behavioral and neural correlates that give rise to executive control as measured by reversal learning, delay discounting, and stop-signal tasks, focusing particularly on our work using rats as a model system."
829,"The impacts of aerosol loading, composition, and water uptake on aerosol extinction variability in the Baltimore–Washington, D.C. region",A. Beyersdorf;L. Ziemba;G. Chen;C. Corr;J. Crawford;G. Diskin;R. Moore;K. Thornhill;E. Winstead;B. Anderson,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,"In order to utilize satellite-based aerosol measurements for the determination of air quality, the relationship between aerosol optical properties (wavelength-dependent, column-integrated extinction measured by satellites) and mass measurements of aerosol loading (PM2.5 used for air quality monitoring) must be understood. This connection varies with many factors including those specific to the aerosol type – such as composition, size, and hygroscopicity – and to the surrounding atmosphere, such as temperature, relative humidity (RH), and altitude, all of which can vary spatially and temporally. During the DISCOVER-AQ (Deriving Information on Surface conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality) project, extensive in situ atmospheric profiling in the Baltimore, MD–Washington, D.C. region was performed during 14 flights in July 2011. Identical flight plans and profile locations throughout the project provide meaningful statistics for determining the variability in and correlations between aerosol loading, composition, optical properties, and meteorological conditions. Measured water-soluble aerosol mass was composed primarily of ammonium sulfate (campaign average of 32%) and organics (57%). A distinct difference in composition was observed, with high-loading days having a proportionally larger percentage of sulfate due to transport from the Ohio River Valley. This composition shift caused a change in the aerosol water-uptake potential (hygroscopicity) such that higher relative contributions of inorganics increased the bulk aerosol hygroscopicity. These days also tended to have higher relative humidity, causing an increase in the water content of the aerosol. Conversely, low-aerosol-loading days had lower sulfate and higher black carbon contributions, causing lower single-scattering albedos (SSAs). The average black carbon concentrations were 240ngm−3 in the lowest 1km, decreasing to 35ngm−3 in the free troposphere (above 3km). Routine airborne sampling over six locations was used to evaluate the relative contributions of aerosol loading, composition, and relative humidity (the amount of water available for uptake onto aerosols) to variability in mixed-layer aerosol extinction. Aerosol loading (dry extinction) was found to be the predominant source, accounting for 88% on average of the measured spatial variability in ambient extinction, with lesser contributions from variability in relative humidity (10%) and aerosol composition (1.3%). On average, changes in aerosol loading also caused 82% of the diurnal variability in ambient aerosol extinction. However on days with relative humidity above 60%, variability in RH was found to cause up to 62% of the spatial variability and 95% of the diurnal variability in ambient extinction. This work shows that extinction is driven to first order by aerosol mass loadings; however, humidity-driven hydration effects play an important secondary role. This motivates combined satellite–modeling assimilation products that are able to capture these components of the aerosol optical depth (AOD)–PM2.5 link. Conversely, aerosol hygroscopicity and SSA play a minor role in driving variations both spatially and throughout the day in aerosol extinction and therefore AOD. However, changes in aerosol hygroscopicity from day to day were large and could cause a bias of up to 27% if not accounted for. Thus it appears that a single daily measurement of aerosol hygroscopicity can be used for AOD-to-PM2.5 conversions over the study region (on the order of 1400km2). This is complimentary to the results of Chu et al. (2015), who determined that the aerosol vertical distribution from ""a single lidar is feasible to cover the range of 100km"" in the same region."
830,The indirect antioxidant sulforaphane protects against thiopurine-mediated photooxidative stress,A. Benedict;E. Knatko;A. Dinkova-Kostova,Carcinogenesis,"Long-term treatment with thiopurines, such as the widely used anticancer, immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agent azathioprine, combined with exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is associated with increased oxidative stress, hyperphotosensitivity and high risk for development of aggressive squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. Sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate derived from broccoli, is a potent inducer of endogenous cellular defenses regulated by transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), including cytoprotective enzymes and glutathione, which in turn act as efficient indirect and direct antioxidants that have long-lasting effects. Treatment with 6-thioguanine, a surrogate for azathioprine, leads to profound sensitization to oxidative stress and glutathione depletion upon exposure to UVA radiation, the damaging effects of which are primarily mediated by generation of reactive oxygen species. The degree of sensitization is greater for irradiation exposures spanning the absorption spectrum of 6-thioguanine, and is dependent on the length of treatment and the level of guanine substitution with 6-thioguanine, suggesting that the 6-thioguanine that is incorporated in genomic DNA is largely responsible for this sensitization. Sulforaphane provides protection against UVA, but not UVB, radiation without affecting the levels of 6-thioguanine incorporation into DNA. The protective effect is lost under conditions of Nrf2 deficiency, implying that it is due to induction of Nrf2-dependent cytoprotective proteins, and that this strategy could provide protection against any potentially photosensitizing drugs that generate electrophilic or reactive oxygen species. Thus, our findings support the development of Nrf2 activators as protectors against drug-mediated photooxidative stress and encourage future clinical trials in populations at high risk for cutaneous photodamage and photocarcinogenesis."

Irabien,Environmental Technology,"The influence of the binder/waste ratio (AG/WS) on the leaching characteristics of two solidified/stabilized (S/S) steel foundry dusts has been investigated. Leach testing of the solidified products using the Toxic Characterization Leaching Procedure was used to determine the levels of Cd, Pb, Cr and Zn in leachates. The results show that the waste/binder ratio significantly influence the ability of solidified dusts to pass US EPA regulations. For the two wastes investigated minimum waste/binder ratios of 0.37 and 0.25 are recommended for CSFD and SSFD dusts, respectively."

The technique of Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching was applied for the first time on real cheese, in order to investigate the relationships between molecular diffusion and the cheese composition and/or its microstructure. Measured effective diffusion coefficients in soft and hard cheese of a group of dextrans (10–500 kDa) were found to be in the same order of magnitude with values observed when using a comparable non-fat model cheese (∼0.1–20 μm2 s−1). Diffusion of the dextrans was mainly dependent on the fraction of “free” aqueous phase present in the cheese, closely which is linked to cheese-making technology and ripening stage. Diffusion coefficients were modeled by a power law relationship as a function of dextran molecular weight, which allowed some study of the cheese microstructure. A tighter protein network will require some deformation of those flexible macromolecules with a higher molecular weight (&gt;250 kDa), in order to diffuse through the pores of such cheese structures.Diffusion of dextrans in different real cheeses throughout ripening was studied by FRAP.Diffusion coefficients followed a power law relationship as a function of dextran molecular weight.Diffusion behavior was linearly correlated with the “free” aqueous phase of cheese.Modeling diffusion of dextrans allowed some study of the cheese microstructure.In cheese technology, the diffusion phenomena are crucial during ripening.

Westendorp,Genes and Immunity,"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) production is under tight genetic control in populations living in affluent environments. However, little is known about the role of IL10 genetics on cytokine production in populations living in environments with high infectious pressure. We have previously reported that, in a rural Ghanaian population, the most common IL10 haplotype associates with a pro-inflammatory response. Here, we aim to replicate these findings in an independent sample of the same population 2 years later. IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) protein concentrations were determined in whole-blood samples ex vivo stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and zymosan in 2006 (n=615) and 2008 (n=647). The association between IL10 single nucleotide polymorphisms and Z-scores of IL-10 and TNF-α levels was analysed in each population subset. The most common IL10 haplotype was associated with a significantly lower IL-10 production and nonsignificantly increased TNF-α levels. The correlation between repeated cytokine assays, based on 111 individuals with measurements in both 2006 and 2008, was r=0.53 (P<0.001) for IL-10 and r=0.36 (P<0.001) for TNF-α. The replication of our previously found effect of variation in the IL10 gene on IL-10 production and the correlation between repeated cytokine stimulation assays provide evidence that IL10 genetics have an important role in regulating the host response under high infectious pressure.Interleukin-10 (IL-10) production is under tight genetic control in populations living in affluent environments.

834,"The influence of learning methods on collaboration: Prior repeated retrieval enhances retrieval organization, abolishes collaborative inhibition, and promotes post-collaborative memory.",A. Congleton;S. Rajaram,Journal of Experimental Psychology: General,"Research on collaborative memory has unveiled the counterintuitive yet robust phenomenon that collaboration impairs group recall. A candidate explanation for this collaborative inhibition effect is the disruption of people's idiosyncratic retrieval strategies during collaboration, and it is hypothesized that employing methods that improve one's organization protects against retrieval disruption. Here it is investigated how one's learning method during the study phase—defined as either repeatedly studying or repeatedly retrieving information—influences retrieval organization and what effects this has on collaborative recall and post-collaborative individual recall. Results show that repeated retrieval consistently eliminated collaborative inhibition. This enabled participants to gain the most from re-exposure to materials recalled by their partners that they themselves did not recall and led to improvements in their individual memory following collaboration. This repeated retrieval advantage stemmed from the preferential manner in which this learning method strengthened retrieval organization. Findings are also discussed that reveal a relationship between retrieval organization and the interaction observed between learning method and short versus long delay seen in the testing effect literature. Finally, results show that the elusive benefits of cross-cuing during collaboration may be best detected with a longer study–test delay. Together, these findings illuminate when and how collaboration can enhance memory."
835,The institute as container of unconscious feelings: The therapeutic challenge of adolescents in residential care,A. Collie,Journal of Social Work Practice,"The origins of the failure of many residential institutions caring for adolescents are explored. The changing social and economic context over the past 20 years is outlined as a contributory factor. The unconscious processes within institutions caring for very damaged young people are examined in detail, with particular emphasis on the role of projective identification. A comparative study is made of two contrasting institutions a psychodynamic therapeutic community, and a Social Services Community Home from the perspective of their different approaches to unconscious processes. Implications for practice are drawn, illustrated with case studies. The significance of some of these issues for Social Work managers is noted as they are increasingly being required to provide residential treatment for damaged adolescents."

837,The interactions of metal concentrations and soil properties on toxic metal accumulation of native plants in vanadium mining area,A. Aihemaiti;J. Jiang;D. Li;N. Liu;Q. Zou,Journal of Environmental Management,"High demand of Vanadium (V) in high-strength steel and battery manufacturing industry led to extensive V mining activity in China, and caused multi-metal pollution of soil around V mining area. To understand the phytoremediation potentials of native plants grown in V mining area, and the effect of soil properties and soil metal concentrations on toxic metal accumulations of native plants. Setaria viridis, Kochia scoparia and Chenopodium album were sampled from different sites in V mining area, soil properties, soil metal concentrations and metal accumulation amount of investigated plants were measured, bioaccumulation (BAF) and translocation (TF) efficiencies were calculated. Soil pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and available phosphorous (P) can significantly affect V and copper (Cu) uptake in the shoots of Setaria viridis while soil metal contents were lower than the permissible limits. Soil pH can significantly affect V accumulations in the roots and shoots of Kochia scoparia grown in slightly V polluted soils. Setaria viridis exhibited TF &gt; 1 for moderately V and slightly chromium (Cr) polluted soils, and BAF&gt;1 for slightly Cu contaminated soils respectively. Kochia scoparia and Chenopodium album showed TF &gt; 1 and BAF&gt;1 for slightly V polluted soils, respectively. Setaria viridis was practical for in situ phytoextractions of moderately V and slightly Cr polluted soils, and phytostabilization of slightly Cu contaminated soils. Kochia scoparia and Chenopodium album could be used as phytoextractor and phytostablizer in slightly V polluted soils in V mining area. Metal uptake of native plants grown in slightly multi-metal contaminated sites in V mining area can be manipulated by altering soil properties."
838,The jointness of audit fees and demand for MAS: A self‐selection analysis,A. Abdel‐Khalik,Contemporary Accounting Research,"This paper has two objectives: (1) providing a method to evaluate directly the costs (benefits) of knowledge spillovers arising from purchasing MAS from the incumbent auditor, and (2) examining the effect of estimates of the cost of auditor change on clients' ability to capture the resulting cost savings. The first is achieved by using self‐selection bias parameters estimated from switching regressions. The latter is based on data generated from clients' assessments of auditor change costs and the related economic conditions. For a sample of 84 companies, the results indicate that purchasing MAS from the incumbent auditor does not have a bearing on audit fees. The paper also provides an application of the Heckman‐Lee method of correcting for self‐selection bias."
839,The modern Po Delta system: Lobe switching and asymmetric prodelta growth,A. Correggiari;A. Cattaneo;F. Trincardi,Marine Geology,"The modern Po Delta system, comprising five main delta lobes, has been investigated by integrating VHR seismic surveys, recorded offshore from water depths as shallow as 5 m to the toe of the prodelta in about 30 m, with accurate historical cartography extending back several centuries. Previous studies give sedimentological and geochronological information from precisely positioned sediment cores. This combined historical and stratigraphic reconstruction of the modern Po prodelta allows volumetric reconstructions indicating an average sediment load of 9.4 106 t yr− 1 for Po di Pila and Po di Goro-Gnocca lobes. This estimate is remarkably consistent with the total sediment load of 11.5 106 t yr− 1 available for parts of the last century from a gauge station at the apex of the delta plain (in Pontelagoscuro).These integrated stratigraphic studies allow to explain the key characters of the Po delta system: a) the marked asymmetry of the whole delta-prodelta system reflecting prevailing sediment dispersal to the south of each individual delta outlet; b) the shore-parallel overlapping of successive prodelta lobes fed by distinct river outlets of ever changing relative importance; c) the delta outlets being artificially forced in a fixed position so that natural avulsion is prevented and delta lobes undergo headland retreat leaving a marked erosion on the prodelta; d) the presence of prodelta lobes showing widespread “cut-and-fill” features (ranging from 100 to 300 m and depths up to 4–5 m filled with massive silt to very fine sand) offshore of short-lived very active distributary channels (e.g.: Po di Tolle lobe) and suggesting that, in some particular interval, short-lived episodes of submarine erosion are induced by catastrophic increases in river discharge (of natural origin or induced by human maintenance). The seismic stratigraphy of the modern Po Delta documents that markedly distinct prodelta architectures form when a newly activated lobe is located updrift (north, in this case) or downdrift (south) of the one that is retreating: in the first case the abandoned lobe becomes sheltered by the new, rapidly advancing, one; in the opposite case the retreating lobe is updrift and a substantial portion of the sediment is cannibalized and transported to the new lobe, downdrift.The modern Po Delta system, comprising five main delta lobes, has been investigated by integrating VHR seismic surveys, recorded offshore from water depths as shallow as 5 m to the toe of the prodelta in about 30 m, with accurate historical cartography extending back several centuries.

This estimate is remarkably consistent with the total sediment load of 11.5 106 t yr− 1 available for parts of the last century from a gauge station at the apex of the delta plain (in Pontelagoscuro).These integrated stratigraphic studies allow to explain the key characters of the Po delta system: a) the marked asymmetry of the whole delta-prodelta system reflecting prevailing sediment dispersal to the south of each individual delta outlet; b) the shore-parallel overlapping of successive prodelta lobes fed by distinct river outlets of ever changing relative importance; c) the delta outlets being artificially forced in a fixed position so that natural avulsion is prevented and delta lobes undergo headland retreat leaving a marked erosion on the prodelta; d) the presence of prodelta lobes showing widespread “cut-and-fill” features (ranging from 100 to 300 m and depths up to 4–5 m filled with massive silt to very fine sand) offshore of short-lived very active distributary channels (e.g.: Po di Tolle lobe) and suggesting that, in some particular interval, short-lived episodes of submarine erosion are induced by catastrophic increases in river discharge (of natural origin or induced by human maintenance). The seismic stratigraphy of the modern Po Delta documents that markedly distinct prodelta architectures form when a newly activated lobe is located updrift (north, in this case) or downdrift (south) of the one that is retreating: in the first case the abandoned lobe becomes sheltered by the new, rapidly advancing, one; in the opposite case the retreating lobe is updrift and a substantial portion of the sediment is cannibalized and transported to the new lobe, downdrift."
840,The narrative approach in research and its use for policy advice,A. Barabasch,International Journal of Lifelong Education,"Recent developments in Europe show that policymakers acknowledge the role of qualitative research in evidence building. A number of qualitative research studies, including narrative inquiry, have been contracted out to gather information into selected policy issues. The management of career transitions and lifelong learning has become a focus of research and policy interest in many countries. Based on the findings of two Cedefop studies, which included the collection of narrative interviews among mid-career adults in several European countries, this article argues in favour of narrative inquiry as a tool to inform policymakers and influences policies, for example in the field of career guidance and counselling and lifelong learning. A selection of narratives is provided as an example to show how unique situated knowledge within the context of mid-career adults’ life is influenced by existing policies or implies that policies need to be changed. By providing snapshots of the findings from these two studies and exemplify their informative value for policy, the article advocates for the usefulness of narrative inquiry. The presentation of qualitative data humanises the commonly found statistical representations of individuals’ life circumstances and enables imagination and meaning making."

842,"The nature of the cell cycle in neurons: Focus on a ""non-canonical"" pathway of DNA replication causally related to death",A. Copani;F. Caraci;J. Hoozemans;M. Calafiore;F. Nicoletti,Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Molecular Basis of Disease,"The mechanism whereby a reactivation of cell cycle in neurons causes cell death is beginning to be identified. In cellular models of Alzheimer's disease, activation of a non-canonical pathway of DNA replication contributes to neuronal death. This pathway involves the repair enzyme DNA polymerase-β, which is highly expressed in neurons of the Alzheimer's brain at early stages of the disease. Loading of DNA polymerase-β into the replication forks generates a death signal, which involves the tumor suppressor p53. The increasing knowledge of the main actors of the unscheduled DNA replication in neurons will pave the way for novel therapeutic interventions in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders."

Oster,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) - Neuroscience,"We present a model to explain how the neurosecretory system of aquatic mollusks generates their diversity of shell structures and pigmentation patterns. The anatomical and physiological basis of this model sets it apart from other models used to explain shape and pattern. The model reproduces most known shell shapes and patterns and accurately predicts how the pattern alters in response to environmental disruption and subsequent repair. Finally, we connect the model to a larger class of neural models."
844,The origin of the interaction between learning method and delay in the testing effect: The roles of processing and conceptual retrieval organization,A. Congleton;S. Rajaram,Memory & Cognition,"Recent research has demonstrated a relationship between retrieval organization and the efficacy of prior repeated retrieval on delayed tests. The present study asked why repeated study engenders higher recall at a short delay despite lower retrieval organization but produces a decline at a long delay, and why repeated retrieval engenders lower recall at a short delay despite higher retrieval organization but produces stable recall over time. This relationship was examined through the inclusion of two successive recall tests—one immediately after learning method and one a week later. Results replicated the interaction in recall between learning method and delay characterizing the testing effect and, critically, revealed the qualitative differences inherent in the retrieval organization of each method. Specifically, stable recall in repeated retrieval was accompanied by strong and sustained conceptual organization, whereas organization for repeated study was tenuous and weakened across tests. These differences quantitatively were assessed through the use of five targeted analyses: specifically, the examination of cumulative recall curves, the accumulation of organization across time (a curve akin to cumulative recall), item gains and losses across time, changes in the size of categories across time, and the fate of specific clusters of recalled items across time. These differences are discussed within the context of differential processes occurring during learning method."
845,The p53 codon 72 (Arg72Pro) polymorphism is associated with the degree of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic subjects: a cross-sectional study,A. Bonfigli;C. Sirolla;R. Testa;M. Cucchi;L. Spazzafumo;S. Salvioli;A. Ceriello;F. Olivieri;R. Festa;A. Procopio;G. Brandoni;M. Boemi;M. Marra;C. Franceschi,Acta Diabetologica,"Tumor suppressor protein p53 has been demonstrated to regulate genes involved in energy generating metabolic pathways and apoptosis. To date, a new field of research is the involvement of TP53 codon 72 (Arg72Pro) polymorphism in the diabetic disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the genotype and the related genetic models of Arg72Pro polymorphism of TP53 (rs1042522) are associated with insulin resistance and its metabolic parameters in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. We examined 335 type 2 diabetic patients (65.5 ± 8.4 years) and 367 non-diabetic subjects (60.5 ± 11.7 years). The results were validated in a validation sample consisting of 199 type 2 diabetic (66.2 ± 8.5 years) and 224 non-diabetic subjects (61.2 ± 12.7 years). In the study sample, the analysis of covariance, adjusted for the effects of age, gender and BMI, showed a significant genotype–diabetes effect on insulin resistance evaluated by HOMA-IR (p = 0.038). This result was mediated by variations in fasting plasma insulin (p = 0.027), as no TP53 genotype–diabetes effects were detected for fasting plasma glucose. In particular, in the diabetic subjects, Pro/Pro genotype was associated with lower values of HOMA-IR with respect to Arg/Arg (p = 0.013) and Arg/Pro (p = 0.006) carriers. No difference in HOMA-IR between diabetic and non-diabetic Pro/Pro carriers was found. Significant recessive model–diabetes interaction effects on fasting insulin and HOMA-IR adjusted for age, sex and BMI were found (p = 0.007 and p = 0.029, respectively). Linear regression analyses, based on the assumption of an additive genetic model adjusted for age, sex and BMI, highlight p53 gene–diabetes interaction effects on fasting insulin (β = −1.27; p = 0.001) and HOMA-IR (β = −0.22; p = 0.006). The results of statistical analyses on fasting insulin and HOMA-IR were all confirmed in the validation sample. Furthermore, the logistic regression models confirmed that the effect of HOMA-IR levels on diabetes was moderated by Pro/Pro genotype in both study and validation samples (OR = 0.29, p = 0.034, 95 % CI = 0.09–0.91, OR = 0.37, p = 0.035, 95 % CI = 0.15–0.93, respectively). Our findings suggest that p53 codon 72 (Arg72Pro) polymorphism influences insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic patients independently of body mass."
846,The perceived sweetness and price of bottled drinks' silhouettes,A. Arboleda;C. Arce-Lopera,Food Quality and Preference,"This research supports the cross-modal correspondence between the shape of the bottle and consumers’ perception of sweetness and price using physical measures of beverage bottles. Images that add visual weight to the lower section of a package increase the perception of attributes associated with sweetness. In terms of price, the shape of the bottle is informative about its volume, which is the cue predictor of price. Through a within-subject experiment, we evaluated consumers’ perceptions of sweetness and price for a sample of 15 soft drink bottle silhouettes. These perceptions were correlated with the psychophysical characteristics of the silhouettes. Results reveal that sweetness has a negative correlation with height and the visual weight towards the bottom of the bottle. Instead, the price has a positive correlation with the area, width, height, lid, and variance of the bottle shape. Practical implications support having a package design that is consistent with product positioning and attributes."
847,The playground rocker: A metaphor for communication after treatment for adults who stutter,A. Cream;A. Packman;G. Llewellyn,International Journal of Speech-Language Pathology,"In a qualitative study, 10 adults who stutter were interviewed to investigate their experience of treatment. They had all previously participated in behavioural treatments for stuttering that involved one of the variants of prolonged speech. In this type of treatment, people learn to use prolonged speech to control their stuttering. One of the themes to emerge was how difficult it is to use prolonged speech in many everyday communication contexts. The participants reported having an ongoing fear that they would lose control over their stuttering. A metaphor involving the playground rocker was developed to illustrate this experience. The metaphor also suggests strategies that might help people reduce these feelings of loss of control. These include improving conversational skills and reducing speech-related anxiety. Although developed for people who stutter, the metaphor also has implications for other communication disorders."
848,The price of the precautionary principle: Cost-effectiveness of BSE intervention strategies in the Netherlands,A. Benedictus;H. Hogeveen;B. Berends,Preventive Veterinary Medicine,"Since 1996, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle has been linked to a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a fatal brain disease in man. This paper assessed the cost-effectiveness of BSE control strategies instituted by the European Commission. In a Monte Carlo simulation model, a non-intervention baseline scenario was compared to three intervention strategies: removal of specified risk materials from slaughter animals, post-mortem testing for BSE and the culling of feed and age cohorts of BSE cases. The food risk in the baseline scenario ranged from 16.98 lost life years in 2002 to 2.69 lost life years in 2005. Removing specified risk materials removal practices, post-mortem testing and post-mortem testing plus cohort culling reduced this risk with 93%, 82.7% and 83.1%. The estimated cost-effectiveness of all BSE measures in the Netherlands ranged from 4.3 million euros per life year saved in 2002 to 17.7 million euros in 2005. It was discussed that the cost-effectiveness of BSE control strategies will further deviate from regular health economics thresholds as BSE prevalence and incidence declines."
849,"The propeptide of macrophage inhibitory cytokine (MIC‐1), a TGF‐β superfamily member, acts as a quality control determinant for correctly folded MIC‐1",A. Bauskin;H. Zhang;W. Fairlie;X. He;P. Russell;A. Moore;D. Brown;K. Stanley;S. Breit,EMBO Journal,"Macrophage inhibitory cytokine (MIC‐1), a divergent member of the transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) superfamily and activation associated cytokine, is secreted as a 28 kDa dimer. To understand its secretion, we examined its processing in MIC‐1‐transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Mature MIC‐1 dimer arises post‐endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by proteolytic cleavage of dimeric pro‐MIC‐1 precursor at a furin‐like site. Unlike previously characterized TGF‐β superfamily members, MIC‐1 dimers are also secreted in constructs lacking the propeptide. A clue to the function of the propeptide came from the observation that a range of proteasome inhibitors, including lactacystin and MG132, cause major increases in levels of undimerized pro‐MIC‐1 precursor. There was no effect of proteasome inhibitors on cells expressing mature MIC‐1 without the propeptide, suggesting that the propeptide can signal misfolding of MIC‐1, leading to proteasomal degradation. Deletion mutagenesis showed the N‐terminal 28 amino acids of the propeptide are necessary for proteasomal degradation. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of a quality control function in a propeptide domain of a secretory protein and represents an additional mechanism to ensure correct folding of proteins leaving the ER."
850,The properties of nanocomposite aluminium–silicon based thin films deposited by filtered arc deposition,A. Bendavid;P. Martin;H. Takikawa,Thin Solid Films,"Thin films of aluminium silicon oxynitride have been deposited on conducting (100) silicon wafers by filtered arc deposition (FAD) under nitrogen and/or oxygen gas flow. The influence of the N2/O2 flow ratio on the crystal structure, optical and mechanical properties has been investigated. The results of X-ray diffraction showed that the film structure comprised of an AlN crystallite with amorphous Si3N4 and SiOx. The optical properties over the range of 350–800 nm were measured using spectroscopic ellipsometry and found to be strongly dependent on N2/O2 flow ratio. The refractive index values of the films were measured to be in the range of 2.2–1.64 at a wavelength of 670 nm for oxygen flow range of 0–100%. The hardness of the films was found to be strongly dependent on the oxygen content in the film. The hardness range of the films was between 10 and 22 GPa and for the stress between 0.3 and 1.2 GPa."

854,The reduction of tris-dithiolene complexes of molybdenum(VI) and tungsten(VI) by hydroxide ion: kinetics and mechanism,A. Cervilla;F. Pérez-Plá;E. Llopis;M. Piles,Dalton Transactions,"The kinetic study of the spontaneous reduction of some neutral tris-dithiolene complexes [ML3] of molybdenum(VI) and tungsten(VI), (L = S2C6H42−, S2C6H3CH32− and S2C2(CH3)22−; M = Mo or W) by tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in tetrahydrofuran-water solutions demonstrates that OH− is an effective reductant. Their reduction is fast, clean and quantitative. Depending upon both the molar ratio in which the reagents are mixed and the amount of water present, one- or two-electron reductions of these tris-dithiolene complexes were observed. If Bu4NOH is present in low concentration or/and at high concentrations of water, the total transformation of the neutral M(VI) complex into the monoanionic M(V) complex is the only observed process. Stopped-flow kinetic data for this reaction are consistent with the rate law: –d[ML3]/dt = d[ML3−]/dt = k[ML3][Bu4NOH]. The proposed mechanism involves nucleophilic attack of OH− to form a mono-anionic seven-coordinate intermediate [ML3OH]−, which interacts with another molecule of [ML3] to generate the monoanionic complex [ML3]− transfering the oxygen from coordinated OH− to water. Hydrogen peroxide was identified as the reaction product. The molybdenum complexes are more difficult to reduce than their corresponding tungsten complexes, and the values of k obtained for the molybdenum and tungsten series of complexes increase as the ene-1,2-dithiolate ligand becomes more electron-withdrawing (S2C6H42− > S2C6H3CH32− > S2C2(CH3)22−). This investigation constitutes the only well-established interaction between hydroxide ion and a tris(dithiolene) complex, and supports a highly covalent bonding interaction between the metal and the hydroxide ion that modulates electron transfer reactions within these complexes."
855,The regolith portion of the lunar meteorite Sayh al Uhaymir 169,A. Al‐Kathiri;E. Gnos;B. Hofmann,Meteoritics & Planetary Science,"— –Sayh al Uhaymir (SaU) 169 is a composite lunar meteorite from Oman that consists of polymict regolith breccia (8.44 ppm Th), adhering to impact‐melt breccia (IMB; 32.7 ppm Th). In this contribution we consider the regolith breccia portion of SaU 169, and demonstrate that it is composed of two generations representing two formation stages, labeled II and III. The regolith breccia also contains the following clasts: Ti‐poor to Ti‐rich basalts, gabbros to granulites, and incorporated regolith breccias. The average SaU 169 regolith breccia bulk composition lies within the range of Apollo 12 and 14 soil and regolith breccias, with the closest correspondence being with that of Apollo 14, but Sc contents indicate a higher portion of mare basalts. This is supported by relations between Sm‐Al2O3, FeO‐Cr2O3‐TiO2, Sm/Eu and Th‐K2O. The composition can best be modeled as a mixture of high‐K KREEP, mare basalt and norite/troctolite, consistent with the rareness of anorthositic rocks. The largest KREEP breccia clast in the regolith is identical in its chemical composition and total REE content to the incompatible trace‐element (ITE)‐ rich high‐K KREEP rocks of the Apollo 14 landing site, pointing to a similar source. In contrast to Apollo 14 soil, SaU 169 IMB and SaU 169 KREEP breccia clast, the SaU 169 regolith is not depleted in K/Th, indicating a low contribution of high‐Th IMB such as the SaU 169 main lithology in the regolith. The data presented here indicate the SaU 169 regolith breccia is from the lunar front side, and has a strong Procellarum KREEP Terrane signature."
856,The relationship between contract type and job satisfaction in a mediated moderation model: The role of job insecurity and psychological contract violation,A. Callea;F. Urbini;E. Ingusci;A. Chirumbolo,Economic and Industrial Democracy,"In the last decades, research on the relationship between contract type, job insecurity and outcomes has been constantly increasing. Previous evidence indicated that job insecurity moderates the impact of contract type (permanent vs temporary) on job satisfaction. The present study aims to investigate these relationships considering two facets (intrinsic and extrinsic) of job satisfaction and psychological contract violation as mediator, in the mediated moderation model. Participants were 638 employees of different Italian organizations, with open-ended or fixed-term contract. As hypothesized, results indicated that job insecurity moderates the relationship between contract type and intrinsic and extrinsic job satisfaction differently for contract type. The job insecurity effects were more negative for permanent workers regarding intrinsic job satisfaction and more negative for temporary workers regarding extrinsic job satisfaction. The mediated moderation analyses supported the study’s main hypothesis, pointing out that psychological contract violation negatively mediated the interaction effects."
857,The relationship between stimulus intensity and response amplitude for the photopic negative response of the flash electroretinogram,A. Binns;K. Mortlock;R. North,Documenta Ophthalmologica,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between stimulus intensity and response amplitude for the photopic negative response (PhNR) of the flash ERG. Specific aims were (i) to determine whether a generalized Naka–Rushton function provided a good fit to the intensity–response data and (ii) to determine the variability of the parameters of the best-fitting Naka–Rushton models. Electroretinograms were recorded in 18 participants, on two occasions, using both DTL fibre and skin active electrodes, in response to Ganzfeld red stimuli (Lee filter “terry red”) ranging in stimulus strength from −1.30 to 0.53 log cd.s.m−2 (0.28–2.11 log phot td.s) presented over a steady blue background (Schott glass filter BG28; 3.9 log scot td). PhNR amplitude was measured from b-wave peak and from pre-stimulus baseline. The Naka–Rushton function was fitted to all intensity–response data, and parameters, ‘n’, ‘Vmax’ and ‘K’ were obtained. Coefficients of variation (CoV), and inter-ocular and inter-session limits of agreement (LoA) were calculated for both Naka–Rushton parameters. A generalized Naka–Rushton function was found to provide a good fit to the intensity–response data, except at the highest stimulus intensity, where a reduction in amplitude occurred in many individuals. The ‘Vmax’ parameter was less variable than ‘K’ for all intensity–response data. Variability was lower for DTL than skin electrodes, and for peak-to-trough PhNR measurements, compared to baseline-to-trough. This study has demonstrated for the first time that the Naka–Rushton model provides a useful means of quantifying the intensity–response relationship of the PhNR."

Due to the presence of PEPT2 at the bronchial epithelium, the aerosolic administration of peptide-like drugs might play a major role in future treatment of various pulmonary and systemic diseases. Moreover, PEPT2 has a significant influence on the in vivo disposition and half-life time of peptide-like drugs within the body, particularly in kidney and brain. PEPT2 is known to have similar but not identical structural requirements for substrate recognition and transport compared to PEPT1, its intestinal counterpart. In this review we compiled available affinity constants of 352 compounds, measured at different mammalian tissues and expression systems and compare the data whenever possible with those of PEPT1."
859,The role of international travel in the worldwide spread of multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae,A. Bij;J. Pitout,Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy,"From international tourists to war-displaced refugees, more people are on the move than ever before. This provides the opportunity for a variety of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria to be carried from one geographic location to another. The Enterobacteriaceae are among the most important causes of serious hospital-acquired and community-onset bacterial infections in humans, and resistance to antimicrobial agents in these bacteria has become an increasingly relevant problem. International travel and tourism are important modes for the acquisition and spread of antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, especially CTX-M-producing Escherichia coli. Infections with KPC-, VIM-, OXA-48- and NDM-producing Enterobacteriaceae in developed countries have been associated with visiting and being hospitalized in endemic areas such as the USA, Greece and Israel for KPCs, Greece for VIMs, Turkey for OXA-48, and the Indian subcontinent for NDMs. To combat the spread of antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, the French Healthcare Safety Advisory Committee recently issued national recommendations for screening and contact isolation precautions for patients transferred from, or hospitalized outside, France. For effective public and patient health interventions, it is important to understand the role of international travel in the spread of antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. We urgently need well-designed studies to evaluate the transmission potential and risks for colonization and infections due to multiresistant Enterobacteriaceae in travellers who have recently visited or have been hospitalized in endemic areas. The emergence of CTX-M-, KPC- and NDM-producing bacteria is a good example of the role that globalization plays in the rapid dissemination of new antibiotic resistance mechanisms."
860,The role of outcome expectations in the generation of the feedback‐related negativity,A. Bismark;G. Hajcak;N. Whitworth;J. Allen,Psychophysiology,"The feedback‐related negativity (FRN) is thought to index activity within the midbrain dopaminergic reward‐learning system, with larger FRN magnitudes observed when outcomes are worse than expected. This view holds that the FRN is an index of neural activity coding for prediction errors, and reflects activity that can be used to adaptively alter future performance. Untested to date, however, is a key prediction of this view: the FRN should not appear in response to negative outcomes when outcome expectations are not allowed to develop. The current study tests this assumption by eliciting FRNs to win and loss feedback in conditions of participant choice, participant observation of computer choice, and, critically, simple presentation of win or loss feedback in the absence of a predictive choice cue. Whereas FRNs were observed in each of the conditions in which there was time for an expectation to develop, no FRN was observed in conditions without sufficient time for the development of an expectation. These results provide empirical support for an untested but central tenet of the reinforcement learning account of the genesis of the FRN."
861,The role of oxygen in regulating microRNAs in control of the placental renin–angiotensin system,A. Arthurs;E. Lumbers;S. Delforce;A. Mathe;B. Morris,Molecular Human Reproduction,"Human placental renin–angiotensin system (RAS) expression is highest in early gestation, at a time when placental oxygen tension is at its lowest (1–3%), and promotes placental development. Some miRNAs predicted to target RAS mRNAs are downregulated in early gestation. We tested the hypothesis that low oxygen suppresses expression of miRNAs that target placental RAS mRNAs, thus increasing concentrations of RAS mRNAs. HTR-8/SVneo cells were cultured in 1, 5 and 20% oxygen for 48 h. Differences in miRNA expression were measured on an Affymetrix miRNA microarray (n = 3/group). Those predicted to target RAS mRNAs, or that were decreased in early gestation, were confirmed by qPCR (n = 9/group). RAS protein levels were assessed by ELISAs or immuno-blotting. Microarray analysis identified four miRNAs predicted to target RAS mRNAs that were differentially expressed between 1 and 5% oxygen. Using qPCR, 15 miRNAs that target the RAS were measured in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Five miRNAs were downregulated in 1% compared with 5% oxygen. Expression of a number of RAS mRNAs (ATP6AP2, AGT, ACE and AGTR1) were increased in either, or both, 1 and 5% oxygen compared with 20% oxygen. AGT protein levels were increased in 1% oxygen compared with 5%. Further validation is needed to confirm that these miRNAs target RAS mRNAs directly and that placental development is partly regulated by oxygen-sensitive miRNAs that target RAS mRNAs. Since placental oxygen tension changes across gestation, changes in expression of these miRNAs may contribute to the transgestational changes in placental RAS expression and the resulting effects on placental development."
862,The role of posttraumatic stress and posttraumatic growth on online information use in breast cancer survivors,A. Casellas‐Grau;E. Sumalla;M. Lleras;J. Vives;A. Sirgo;C. León;A. Rodríguez;G. Campos;Y. Valverde;J. Borràs;C. Ochoa,Psycho-Oncology,"Objective Changes perceived as both positive (eg, posttraumatic growth [PTG]) and negative (eg, posttraumatic stress symptoms [PTSS]) have been associated with intensive Internet use among breast cancer survivors. In this multicenter study, we analyzed the role of PTG and PTSS on the amount of time spent looking for online cancer information, its content, and its psychological impact. Methods Posttraumatic stress symptoms and PTG were assessed in 182 breast cancer survivors by using the Post‐traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist and Post‐traumatic Growth Inventory questionnaires. Subjects also completed a questionnaire about their behavior when looking for online illness‐related information (ie, time spent, type of contents, and psychological impact). Results Posttraumatic stress symptoms positively correlated with the amount of time spent looking for cancer‐related information, including both medical and psychosocial content. By contrast, PTG showed no relationships with the amount of time, but with a predominant search for cancer‐related psychosocial information. The psychological impact of online information was associated with participants' levels of PTG and/or PTSS. Whereas PTG was related to a decrease of women's hope, PTSS was linked to the perception of being less conscious or inadequately informed about the illness, thereby increasing feelings of distress. Conclusions Posttraumatic stress symptoms and PTG show relationships with the amount of time spent online, the type of information accessed online, and the psychological impact of Internet use. Health professionals should prescribe online information according to the psychological response to cancer. There is a need for professional‐led online resources to provide patients with timely information as well as support sites to facilitate psychological adjustment."
863,"The role of spatial factors in the success of an Aujeszky's disease eradication programme in a high pig density area (Northeast Spain, 2003–2007)",A. Allepuz;M. Saez;N. Solymosi;S. Napp;J. Casal,Preventive Veterinary Medicine,"We tested the role of several spatial variables on the risk of a sow herd being Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) seropositive in certain areas of North Eastern Spain and during different periods of the eradication programme. Distance to the nearest slaughterhouse, distance to the nearest conventional road and number of ADV serologically positive sows and ADV serologically positive fattening pigs within different distances (1000, 1500 and 2000 m) of each sow herd, were included in a hierarchical Bayesian binomial model. A variable without spatial characteristics, type of herd (farrow to weaning and farrow to finish), was also included. Presence of positive fattening pigs or positive sows up to a distance of 1500 m of a sow herd increased its risk of being seropositive, although this variable had no effect on the risk when located at distances up to 1000 or 2000 m. The number of seropositive sows increased the risk of a sow herd being ADV seropositive only in the first period of study, when the proportion of serologically positive sow herds was nearly 60%. The spatial pattern of the residuals of the hierarchical Bayesian binomial model (observed versus predicted) was very similar to the observed infection in sow herds in all of the eradication periods, showing that spatial factors might not be the main factors related to the eradication of Aujeszky's disease from sow herds. Other herd-specific risk factors might be much more strongly related to the risk of a sow herd being ADV seropositive."
864,The sequence analysis of Epstein–Barr virus EBNA1 gene: could viral screening markers for nasopharyngeal carcinoma be identified?,A. Banko;I. Lazarevic;D. Karalic;V. Djukic;M. Cupic;G. Stevanovic;T. Jovanovic,Structure and Bonding,"Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) has been identified as a group 1 carcinogenic agent, particularly for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The sequence diversity of EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) reflects region-restricted polymorphisms, which may be associated with the development of certain malignancies. The aims of the present study were to evaluate EBV EBNA1 gene polymorphisms circulating in NPC, infectious mononucleosis, and isolates from patients with transplanted organs to determine if EBNA1 sequence specificities are useful as viral biomarkers for NPC. Forty biopsies of undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UCNT), 31 plasma samples from patients with mononucleosis syndrome, and 16 plasma samples from patients after renal transplantation were tested in this study. The EBNA1 gene was amplified by nested PCR. Further investigation included sequencing, phylogenetic, and statistical evaluations. Eighty-seven sequences were identified as one of the four EBNA1 subtypes, P-Ala, P-Thr, V-Val, and V-Ala, with further classification into ten subvariants. Of these, P-Thr-sv-1 and P-Thr-sv-3 have never been identified in Europe, while V-Val-sv-1 was newly discovered. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences in the distribution of EBNA1 P-Thr subvariants between the three groups of patients, with noticeable clustering of P-Thr-sv-5 in NPC isolates (p &lt; 0.001). EBV EBNA1 showed no sequence specificity in primary infection. This research revealed a newly discovered EBNA1 subvariant. Importantly, EBNA1 P-Thr-sv-5 showed carcinoma-specific EBNA1 variability. Thus, identification of this subvariant should be considered as a viral screening marker for NPC or UCNT."
865,The socialization of boys and men in the modern era: An evolutionary mismatch,A. Biglan;M. Ryzin;K. Moore;M. Mauricci;I. Mannan,Development and Psychopathology,"This paper examines the misalignment between modern human society and certain male phenotypes, a misalignment that has been highlighted and explored in great detail in the work of Tom Dishion. We begin by briefly enumerating the ongoing developmental difficulties of many boys and young men and how these difficulties affect them and those around them. We then suggest that the qualities that have been advantageous for men and their families in our earlier evolution but that are often no longer functional in modern society are a source of these problems. Finally, we provide a brief review of prevention programs that can contribute to preventing this type of problematic development and eliciting more prosocial behavior from at-risk boys and men. We conclude with an overview of research and policy priorities that could contribute to reducing the proportion of boys and young men who experience developmental difficulties in making their way in the world."
866,"The specter of scholarship without novel ideas: Replication, hyperauthorship and the danger of stagnation.",A. Cropley,"Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts","Two striking recent trends in discussions of scholarly publishing are, on the one hand, calls for dramatically increased emphasis on replicability as the core indicator of research quality and, on the other, listing everybody who had anything to do with a research project as an author of the project report. These trends have in common that they give at least as much weight to correct application of technical and procedural skills as to generation of novelty. Although replicability and due recognition of people’s contributions to research are highly desirable, there is a danger that both trends will lead to undervaluing the importance of ideas, especially novel, even provocative ideas, and this prospect raises the specter of a focus in knowledge production on artisanship at the expense of creativity, with resulting stagnation."
867,The speech-language pathologist's role in supporting the development of self-regulation: A review and tutorial,A. Binns;L. Hutchinson;J. Cardy,Journal of Communication Disorders,"Children’s engagement in self-regulation is a strong and positive predictor of their social and academic success, making self-regulation an important focus for caregivers and clinicians. The aims of this article are to provide a framework for understanding self-regulation and to identify strategies speech-language pathologists can use to integrate self-regulation work into their clinical practice.Empirically supported considerations describing the developmental progression from co-regulation to self-regulation are outlined, and the effects of stress on self-regulation are discussed. A clinical framework is provided to guide speech-language pathologists in considering stress and self-regulation in their clinical work. Strategies are provided to a) support speech-language pathologists’ employment of co-regulation as a method for mitigating the negative effects that stress can have on therapeutic efforts, and to b) support children’s development of skills (i.e. executive functions, metacognition) required to actively self-regulate.Given that children’s ability to attain a state of regulation is integral to attending, engaging, and learning from their environment, the information provided in this tutorial can be used to inform and enhance current clinical practice."
868,The ups and downs of a canopy-forming seaweed over a span of more than one century,A. Blanfuné;C. Boudouresque;M. Verlaque;T. Thibaut,"Scientific Reports (Bioinformatics, Computational and Systems Biology)","Canopy-forming seaweeds constitute marine forests that deliver ecosystem services. The worldwide range shift, sharp decline or loss of many of these forests, caused by the cumulative impact of increasing human pressure and climate change, have been widely documented. Contrasting examples, reflecting higher than expected resilience, have been more rarely reported. Here, we took the opportunity of having at our disposal a two-century suite of documents (herbarium vouchers, articles) and a ~120-year observation period, dealing with a long-lived brown seaweed, Cystoseira mediterranea, along a well-explored Mediterranean coastline in the Gulf of Lions, to depict the fate of its populations. In addition, we provided baselines for future surveys, with a high degree of accuracy. The northernmost population, scattered on rare suitable substrates, gradually declined and has been extinct since the 1980s. The length of shore occupied by the southern population showed a long-term decline trend, with two sharp minima followed by partial recovery. The causes of the decline differ between sites and periods: coastal development, pollution, competition with mussels, heatwaves and exceptional storms. Overall, the Gulf of Lions populations reflects long-lasting resilience, higher than expected, and a health status that is better than that reported for many other canopy-forming seaweeds."
869,The use of magnetometry and pole-dipole resistivity for locating Nabataean Hawar archeological site in the SW-Jordan,A. Batayneh,Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences,"This paper is focused on the joint use of magnetometry and pole-dipole electrical resistivity geophysical methods for assessing their capability in the detection of a prehistoric site in the southwestern Jordan. The survey area, Auara, was built in the first century BC during the Nabataean time and is located in a very arid environment framed on the east and north by white sandstone hills. In order to test this site, a number of magnetic stations and two pole-dipole resistivity traverses were carried out in the investigated area. Magnetic data were taken with one sensor at height of 0.8 m along survey lines spaced 1 m apart. Resistivity measurements were carried out utilizing the pole-dipole array along two profiles. A total of 32 geoelectrical stations spaced 2 m were made along the two profiles. Magnetic method found structure with contrasting physical properties to those of the surrounding material. The archeological interpretation of such structure is in terms of rectangular cistern (pool) with dimensions 26 × 16 m. A probable location of two buried walls spaced 16 m are indicated by low resistivity values."
870,The vertical flux of particulate matter in the polynya of Terra Nova Bay. Part II. Biological components,A. Accornero;C. Manno;F. Esposito;M. Gambi,Antarctic Science,"Downward fluxes of particulate matter were investigated in the polynya of Terra Nova Bay (western Ross Sea) from February 1995 to December 1997. The main biological components were siliceous phytoplankton (diatoms, silicoflagellates and parmales), abundant faecal pellets of several types and zooplankton (mainly shelled pteropods). Vertical fluxes of particles occurred mainly through diatoms and faecal pellets in the first and second part of the summer, respectively. The highest fluxes were recurrently observed in late summer, when faeces contributed up to 100% of organic carbon. Unusually high fluxes were recorded in winter 1995, when faecal pellets accounted for 84.6% of the organic carbon. Peak fluxes were always driven by the sinking of faecal pellets, that hence appear to be the most efficient vector of export in the polynya of Terra Nova Bay. A major flux component was the pteropod Limacina helicina, which repeatedly sank in high amounts after the growing season. In April–June, L. helicina probably transported biogenic carbon to deep layers as a passive sinker. The inclusion of pteropods in flux estimates resulted in values that were up to 20 (for total mass), 25 (for organic matter) and 48 (for carbonate) times higher than the previously measured fluxes. Fluxes are known to be biased by swimmers, but ultimately attention must be paid to a possible erroneous categorization of some zooplankton as swimmers to avoid severe underestimation of fluxes of total mass (up to 95% in our study), organic matter (up to 96%) and carbonate (up to 100%)."
871,The vertical flux of particulate matter in the polynya of Terra NovaBay. Part I. Chemical constituents,A. Accornero;C. Manno;K. Arrigo;A. Martini;S. Tucci,Antarctic Science,"Downward fluxes of particulate matter were investigated in the polynya of Terra Nova Bay(western Ross Sea) from February 1995 to December 1997. Biogenic silica made up the bulk of the sinkingmatter, reaching a maximum of 85% of the total flux in both the shallow and deep traps. Organic carbonaccounted for 2.1 to 23.5% of the sample mass in the shallow trap and 2.8 to 7.2% in the deep trap. Biogenicsilica and organic carbon peaks occurred in February–March over the three years and were always coupledin the top trap. Carbonate fluxes showed an uneven temporal trend, were low near the seafloor andcontributed up to 69.8% of the material collected by the shallow trap. Vertical fluxes in the polynya showedlarge seasonal and interannual variability. Differences in primary productivity, ice cover dynamics andcurrent energies accounted for the interannual changes in the flux of materials to the subsurface trap.Advection from sites a few hundred kilometres apart was the most likely reason for the decoupling betweenshallow and deep fluxes after October 1996. The seasonal pattern of downward fluxes was essentially linkedto the seasonal cycle of primary production and spring–summer variations largely resulted from thecomposition of the phytoplankton assemblage in the overlying water column. The export of phototrophicallyproduced materials to depth was low in late spring–early summer, at the time when Phaeocystis and smallflagellates were the predominant autotrophs and the microbial food web prevailed over herbivorous feeding.Enhanced fluxes were linked to the predominance of large diatoms above the trap, in late summer. Temporaldynamics in this polynya were delayed by approximately one month as compared to the southernmost RossSea polynya, but showed the same temporal pattern: the time lag between production and accumulation ofbiogenic materials in the upper water column was a few weeks, while the delay in export from the surfacelayer relative to the maximum accumulation of biomass was approximately one month."
872,Theoretical study of the ArH+ photodissociation,A. Alekseyev;H. Liebermann;R. Buenker,Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics,"The multireference Spin–Orbit (SO) Configuration Interaction (CI) method in its Lambda–S Contracted SO–CI (LSC–SO–CI) version is employed to calculate potential energy curves for the ground and low-lying excited states of the ArH+ cation. For the first time, electric dipole moments are also computed in the approach, including SO coupling for transitions to the states responsible for the first absorption continuum (A-band) of ArH+. On this basis, the partial and total absorption spectra in this energy range are obtained. It is shown that absorption in the A-band is dominated by the parallel A1Σ+ ← X1Σ+ transition. In the low-energy part of the band (<95 × 103 cm−1) the absorption is caused by the perpendicular B1Π ← X1Σ+ excitation, but transitions to the b3Π0+,1 states are also not negligible. The branching ratio Γ for the final photodissociation products is calculated and it is shown to increase smoothly from 0 in the red tail of the band to 1 at E ≥ 105 cm−1. The latter value corresponds to the exclusive formation of the spin-excited Ar+(2P1/2) ions, and thus leads to the inverse population of the Ar+(2P1/2 − 2P3/2) ion states."
873,"Thermal analysis, microstructure and acoustic characteristics of some hybrid natural insulating materials",A. Alabdulkarem;M. Ali;G. Iannace;S. Sadek;R. Almuzaiqer,Construction and Building Materials,"Hybrid new insulating materials are proposed using different binders such as cornstarch, glue (wood adhesive) and white cement. Five hybrid samples were produced from date palm trees surface fibers (PTSF) and Apple of Sodom fibers (AOSF) for different ratio of mass and densities. One hybrid sample was produced from AOSF and agave fiber (AF) using glue (wood adhesive) as a binder. Thermal conductivity measurements were conducted for all samples at temperature ranging from 10 °C to 50 °C which resulted in average values of 0.04234–0.05291 W/m K. Microstructure analysis was conducted for AF using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) which resulted in an average diameter range of 170–259 μm. Infrared (FT- IR) Fourier transformation spectra of AF showed ranges of wavenumber functional groups. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA and DTGA) was obtained for AF and showed that the fibers start to degrade and decompose at about 221 °C where the fiber loses 5% of its original mass. The Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis is also reported for AF and shows a broad endothermic transition range of 292–357 °C with a peak at 353 °C. Sound absorption coefficients were obtained for the hybrid samples and indicate the potential of using these samples for sound absorption. The current tests indicate the feasibility of using such hybrid samples as insulating materials for heat as well as sound absorption. The proposed tested hybrid samples are all natural, safe for human beings, utilize the wasted material and biodegradable therefore, it is good for saving our environment."

875,Thermodynamic properties of the fcc Ising antiferromagnet obtained from precision density of states calculations,A. Beath;D. Ryan,Physical Review B,"We calculate the density of states for the face-centered-cubic (fcc) Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions using a Wang-Landau algorithm. This allows us to calculate thermodynamic quantities at all temperatures for both the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) models from the same data set, while avoiding the hysteresis usually occurring in models undergoing a first-order phase transition. For the FM model, our results are in agreement with high-temperature (HT) series expansion results, and are of the same precision. For the AF model which has a first-order transition, and where precise estimates of the critical behavior are lacking, we obtain TN=1.7217(8). We also obtain estimates of the free energy, internal energy, and entropy of both the ordered and disordered states at TN with a precision comparable to that obtained in the HT series for the FM model. Details of the finite-size scaling for the AF model are discussed, and a different convergence criterion for the Wang-Landau method is introduced."
876,Thick junction broadband organic photodiodes,A. Armin;M. Hambsch;I. Kim;P. Burn;P. Meredith;E. Namdas,Laser & Photonics Reviews,"Inorganic semiconductor‐based broadband photodetectors are ubiquitous in imaging technologies such as digital cameras and photometers. Herein a broadband organic photodiode (OPD) that has performance metrics comparable or superior to inorganic photodiodes over the same spectral range is reported. The photodiode with an active layer comprised of a poly[N‐9′‐heptadecanyl‐2,7‐carbazole‐alt‐5,5‐(4′,7′‐di‐2‐thienyl‐2′,1′,3′‐benzothiadiazole)]:[6,6]‐phenyl‐C71‐butyric acid methyl ester bulk heterojunction blend had a dark current < 1 nA/cm2, specific detectivity of ∼1013 Jones, reverse bias −3 dB frequency response of 100 kHz to 1 MHz, and state‐of‐the‐art Linear Dynamic Range for organic photodiodes of nine orders of magnitude (180 dB). The key to these performance metrics was the use of a thick junction (700 nm), which flattened the spectral response, reduced the dark current and decreased performance variations. The strategy also provides a route to large area defect free “monolithic” structures for low noise integrated photo‐sensing, position determination, or contact, non‐focal imaging."
877,Three-Body Decay of $\Lambda_c^{*}(2595)$ and $\Lambda_c^{*}(2625)$ with the Inclusion of Direct Two-Pion Coupling,A. Arifi;H. Nagahiro;A. Hosaka,ArXiv Physics,"We investigate the three-body decays of $\Lambda_c^*(2595)$ and $\Lambda_c^*(2625)$ into $\Lambda_c \pi \pi$ by including a direct process going through the two-pion coupling of $\Lambda_c^*\Lambda_c \pi \pi$ in addition to the sequential processes going through $\Sigma_c(2455)$ and $\Sigma_c^*(2520)$. The strength of the direct coupling is related to that of the Yukawa coupling by the chiral partner structure between $\Lambda_c$'s and $\Sigma_c$'s, while the strength of the Yukawa coupling is estimated by the quark model. It is found that the direct process gives a considerable contribution especially in the decay of $\Lambda_c^*(2625)$. A clear indication of the direct process is seen in an asymmetric pattern in the angular correlation between the two pions. We discuss the usefulness of the detailed analysis of the decays for the study of the structure of $\Lambda_c^*$."

Hosaka,Physical Review D,"Three-body decay of charmed baryons Λc*(2595) and Λc*(2625) into Λcππ are studied with effective Lagrangians in which the coupling constants are extracted from the nonrelativistic quark model. We take into account sequential processes going through Σc(2455) and Σc*(2520) in intermediate states. The total decay widths are sensitive to the coupling of Λc* with Σcπ open channel and to Σc*π closed channel. We find that Λc*(2595) and Λc*(2625) with λ mode assignment can explain the experimental data nicely. We also show invariant mass distributions of Λc*(2595) and Λc*(2625) decays, which are significantly different for various quark configurations."

Gebauer;B. Hartrodt;M. Brandsch;K. Neubert;I. Thondorf,Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,"The utilization of the membrane transport protein PEPT1 as a drug delivery system is a promising strategy to enhance the oral bioavailability of drugs. Since very little is known about the substrate binding site of PEPT1, computational methods are a meaningful tool to gain a more detailed insight into the structural requirements for substrates. Three-dimensional quantitative structure−activity relationship (3D-QSAR) studies using the comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) method were performed on a training set of 98 compounds. Affinity constants of β-lactam antibiotics and tripeptides were determined at Caco-2 cells. A statistically reliable model of high predictive power was obtained (q2 = 0.828, r2 = 0.937). The results derived from CoMSIA were graphically interpreted using different field contribution maps. We identified those regions which are crucial for the interaction between peptidomimetics and PEPT1. The new 3D-QSAR model was used to design a new druglike compound mimicking a dipeptide. The predicted Ki value was confirmed experimentally."

881,Three-dimensional inspiratory flow in the upper and central human airways,A. Banko;F. Coletti;D. Schiavazzi;C. Elkins;J. Eaton,Experiments in Fluids,"The steady inspiratory flow through an anatomically accurate model of the human airways was studied experimentally at a regime relevant to deep inspiration for aerosol drug delivery. Magnetic resonance velocimetry was used to obtain the three-component, mean velocity field. A strong, single-sided streamwise swirl was found in the trachea and persists up to the first bifurcation. There, the swirl and the asymmetric anatomy impact both the streamwise momentum distribution and the secondary flows in the main bronchi, with large differences compared to what is found in idealized branching tubes. In further generations, the streamwise velocity never recovers a symmetric profile and the relative intensity of the secondary flows remains strong. Overall, the results suggest that, in real human airways, both streamwise dispersion (due to streamwise gradients) and lateral dispersion (due to secondary flows) are very effective transport mechanisms. Neglecting the extrathoracic airways and idealizing the bronchial tree may lead to qualitatively different conclusions."
882,"Tibet Lost in Translation: Sovereignty, Suzerainty and International Order Transformation, 1904–1906",A. Cheney,Journal of Contemporary China,"How did Tibet become part of the modern Chinese state? Even today, as Tibet is an internationally recognized part of the People’s Republic of China, the evasive meaning of ‘Chinese suzerainty over Tibet’ is a reverberant point of contention in nationalist debates. The question of whether ‘suzerainty’ more strongly implicates Tibetan independence or Chinese sovereignty is a false controversy that has impeded progress in understanding China’s transition from empire to nation-state. This article examines Anglo–Chinese diplomatic negotiations following the 1904 British invasion of Tibet using newly uncovered Chinese archival documents to demonstrate the central role played by the appropriation and manipulation of international legal discourse in determining Tibet’s status in the international system and offers a generalizable theory of the mechanics of international order transformation."

This technique is demonstrated to be a reliable and very efficient method in terms of speed. Then, based on this model the instantaneous power of the device can be obtained. The performance of the device is shown through the power production matrix and the 60 year series power production statistics.

885,To study the performance of biocarriers in moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) technology and kinetics of biofilm for retrofitting the existing aerobic treatment systems: a review,A. Barwal;R. Chaudhary,Reviews in Environmental Science and Biotechnology,"Moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) incorporates benefits provided by both attached and suspended growth systems. It is an advanced high rate wastewater treatment technology with high treatment efficiency; low capital, operational, maintenance and replacement cost; single reliable and robust operation procedure. Moreover, this technology is applicable to wide range of wastewater flows ranging from 10,000 to 150,000 m3 day−1. The MBBR has proved to be effective in removing up to 90 % chemical oxygen demand and 95 % biochemical oxygen demand with nutrients from the effluent stream at optimum condition, provided there is sufficient retention time. It is a cost-effective way of upgrading existing wastewater treatment system as it is efficient, compact and easy to operate. This process can be provided for new sewage treatment works or for retrofitting existing wastewater treatment plants where a higher treated effluent standard is required without any running and capital cost. The performance of MBBR depends on the percent of media provided in the reactor, surface area of the biocarrier, dissolved oxygen and the organic loading. Various mathematical models are also described in this review paper which is generally used to calculate the reactor volume, effluent organic concentration and substrate removal rate."
886,Topology optimization of lightweight periodic lattices under simultaneous compressive and shear stiffness constraints,A. Asadpoure;L. Valdevit,International Journal of Solids and Structures,"This paper investigates the optimal architecture of planar micro lattice materials for minimum weight under simultaneous axial and shear stiffness constraints. A well-established structural topology optimization approach is used, where the unit cell is composed of a network of beam elements (Timoshenko beams are used instead of truss elements to allow modeling of bending-dominated architectures); starting from a dense unit cell initial mesh, the algorithm progressively eliminates inefficient elements and resizes the essential load-bearing elements, finally converging to an optimal unit cell architecture. This architecture is repeated in both directions to generate the infinite lattice. Hollow circular cross-sections are assumed for all elements, although the shape of the cross-section has minimal effect on most optimal topologies under the linear elasticity assumption made throughout this work. As optimal designs identified by structural topology optimization algorithms are strongly dependent on initial conditions, a careful analysis of the effect of mesh connectivity, unit cell aspect ratio and mesh density is conducted. This study identifies hierarchical lattices that are significantly more efficient than any isotropic lattice (including the widely studied triangular, hexagonal and Kagomé lattices) for a wide range of axial and shear stiffness combinations. As isotropy is not always a design requirement (particularly in the context of sandwich core design, where shear stiffness is generally more important than compressive stiffness), these optimal architectures can outperform any established topology.

887,Topology optimization of multiphase architected materials for energy dissipation,A. Asadpoure;M. Tootkaboni;L. Valdevit,Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering,"In this article, we study the computational design of multiphase architected materials comprising a stiff phase, a dissipative phase, and void space, with enhanced vibration damping characteristics under wave propagation. We develop a topology optimization framework that maximizes a figure of merit comprising of effective stiffness, density and effective damping. We also propose novel material interpolation strategies to avoid the blending of different phases at any given point in the design domain. This is achieved by carefully defining different penalization schemes for different components of the merit function. The effective stiffness of the periodic multiphase material is calculated using homogenization theory and the Bloch–Floquet theorem is used to obtain its damping capacity, allowing for the investigation of the effect of wave directionality, material microarchitecture and intrinsic material properties on the wave attenuation characteristics. It is shown that the proposed topology optimization framework allows for systematic tailoring of microstructure of the multiphase materials for wide ranges of frequencies and densities and results in the identification of optimized multiphase cellular designs with void space that are superior to fully dense topologies."

The project aims to make subterranean formations accessible for public agencies mediating recent environmental conflicts over underground water, which have been diagnosed as the country’s first “water war.” I analyze the presentation to the public of this project and the technology it uses to show how vision and touch are conceptual resources that people use to describe the technicalities of satellite imagery. Attending to the semiotic and technical power of vision and touch requires a nonessentialist understanding of the senses. It requires moving away from a narrow understanding of sensing as embodied, phenomenological practice. Focusing on the role of texture as that which operates in the interstices of vision and touch, I propose going beyond panoptic imaginaries in order to grasp the diverse social lives that technologies such as satellite imaging have."
890,Toward a psychology of human–animal relations.,A. Amiot;B. Bastian;C. Amiot,Psychological Bulletin,"Nonhuman animals are ubiquitous to human life, and permeate a diversity of social contexts by providing humans with food and clothing, serving as participants in research, improving healing, and offering entertainment, leisure, and companionship. Despite the impact that animals have on human lives and vice versa, the field of psychology has barely touched upon the topic of human–animal relations as an important domain of human activity. We review the current state of research on human–animal relations, showing how this body of work has implications for a diverse range of psychological themes including evolutionary processes, development, normative factors, gender and individual differences, health and therapy, and intergroup relations. Our aim is to highlight human–animal relations as a domain of human life that merits theoretical and empirical attention from psychology as a discipline."
891,Toward an eu-Russian Energy Agreement: Principles of Liberalization Under eu and Russian Energy Law,A. Boute,Review of Central and East European Law,"Although the Ukraine conflict and the resulting political hostility between Russia and the West have put a stop to the 2000 eu-Russia Energy Dialogue, the mutual benefits of energy cooperation and cross-border energy investments are undeniable. Taking these mutual benefits into account, energy would be a logical area of focus if the eu and Russia were to decide to re-initiate their strategic partnership in the event of a normalization of the situation in Ukraine. Although this scenario still is highly hypothetical and a further deterioration of eu-Russian relations is possible, it is important to reflect on the creation of institutional structures that would enable the eu and Russia to rebuild trust by working together in a field of common strategic interest. In this context, this article examines the possibility of establishing an eu-Russian energy agreement to overcome the current misunderstandings that exist between the eu and Russia in respect of the interpretation and application of the main concepts of energy law. The legal certainty resulting from such an energy-specific agreement could contribute to improving the investment climate for cross-border eu-Russian energy investments and possibly, through closer investment ties, enhancing trust between the eu and Russia."
892,Toward the regulation of ubiquitous mobile government: a case study on location-based emergency services in Australia,A. Aloudat;K. Michael,Electronic Commerce Research,"Mobile alerts, notifications and location-based emergency warning systems are now an established part of mobile government strategies in an increasing number of countries worldwide. In Australia the national emergency warning system (NEWS) was instituted after the tragic Black Saturday Victorian Bushfires of February 2009. NEWS has enabled the provision of public information from the government to the citizen during emergencies anywhere and any time. Moving on from traditional short message service (SMS) notifications and cell broadcasting to more advanced location-based services, this paper explores the major issues faced by government, business and society at large, toward the realization of a fully fledged emergency system for personal mobile devices. This qualitative study contains two phases: phase 1 gathered issues from the general public via an open-ended survey question, and phase 2 gathered issues from key informant interviews. The data was analyzed using qualitative content analysis techniques. The results are presented in a narrative form granting detailed insight into the main challenges faced in the deployment of a mobile government application. The complex interplay between government agencies, telecommunications carriers and the Australian public is presented, ultimately leading down a path of regulation. By using a qualitative approach it is hoped that the intimate lessons learnt in the Australian landscape can be applied to other nations considering mobile government applications. The outcome of the paper is predominantly practical providing a series of recommendations toward the successful deployment of mobile government applications."

Although the methods used in biology have evolved tremendously in recent years and now involve the routine production of large data sets of varied nature, in many domains of study, including grapevine research, there is a need to improve the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR-ness) of these data. Considering the heterogeneous nature of the data produced, the transnational nature of the scientific community and the experience gained elsewhere, we have formed an open working group, in the framework of the International Grapevine Genome Program (www.vitaceae.org), to construct a coordinated federation of information systems holding grapevine data distributed around the world, providing an integrated set of interfaces supporting advanced data modeling, rich semantic integration and the next generation of data mining tools. To achieve this goal, it will be critical to develop, implement and adopt appropriate standards for data annotation and formatting. The development of this system, the GrapeIS, linking genotypes to phenotypes, and scientific research to agronomical and oeneological data, should provide new insights into grape biology, and allow the development of new varieties to meet the challenges of biotic and abiotic stress, environmental change, and consumer demand.Viticulture, like other fields of agriculture, is currently facing important challenges that will be addressed only through sustained, dedicated and coordinated research.

894,Towards secure big data analytic for cloud-enabled applications with fully homomorphic encryption,A. Alabdulatif;I. Khalil;X. Yi,Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing,"Cloud computing empowers enterprises to efficiently manage big data and discovery of useful information which are the most fundamental challenges for big data enabled applications. The cloud offered unlimited resources that can store, manage and analyse massive and heterogeneous data to improve the quality assurance of application services. Nevertheless, cloud computing is exposed to enormous external and internal privacy breaches and leakage threats. In this paper, we introduce a privacy-preserving distributed analytics framework for big data in cloud. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is used as an emerging and powerful cryptosystem that can carry out analysis tasks on encrypted data. The developed distributed approach has the scalability to partition both data and analysis computations into subset cloud computing nodes that can be run independently. This rapidly accelerates the performance of encrypted data processing while preserving a high level of analysis accuracy. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed framework, in terms of both analysis performance and accuracy, for building a secure analytics cloud-enabled application."
895,Traceless Release of Alcohols Using Thiol-Sensitive Oxanorbornadiene Linkers,A. Aioub;C. Higginson;M. Finn,Organic Letters,"A class of ester–amide oxanorbornadiene (EA-OND) molecules was developed to release alcohol cargos by succinimide formation upon addition of a thiol reagent. The resulting ring-closed adducts undergo further fragmentation by retro-Diels–Alder reaction to release a furan moiety in a manner similar to oxanorbornadiene diesters. The rates of each of these fragmentation pathways in the same medium were found to be sensitive to the steric nature of the amide substituent. Alcohol release was much faster in protic solvents than in aprotic ones, suggesting that this system may be useful for rapid response to thiols in biological environments. Accordingly, the attachment and thiol-dependent release of cholesterol was characterized as an example of the manipulation of a drug-like cargo."
896,Tractor traction performance simulation on differently textured soils and validation: A basic study to make traction and energy requirements accessible to the practice,A. Battiato;E. Diserens,Soil and Tillage Research,"Several models exist to simulate traction performance of a tractor, however, for most of them a proper experimental validation is missing. Moreover, their possible application for a practical use in a wide range of vehicles, equipment and soil configurations has never been further developed. This study examines a semi-empirical model of soil-tyre interaction, adapted to simulate the traction performance of mechanical front wheel drive tractors, taking into account not only mechanical soil and tyre parameters and static vehicle load but also the multi-pass effect, the load transfer effect, and the theoretical speed ratio between front and rear axles. This model simulates drawbar pull, traction coefficient, traction efficiency, and motion resistance as a function of slip, wheel load, tyre size and pressure. Several traction tests were performed on four Swiss agricultural soils of different type (clay, clay loam, silty loam, and loamy sand) in order to validate the model experimentally. Three tractors of widely ranging power (from 40 to 132 kW) and weight (from 24 to 68 kN) were used. Tractor configurations were varied by changing tyre pressure and tractor weight. Slip normally ranged between 5 and 30%. In most of the cases the model simulated drawbar pull as well as its variations due to changes in tyre pressure, wheel load, and soil strength reliably for practical purposes. Only when high wheel load was combined with low inflation pressure the model did not give suitable results due to an overestimation of the rolling radius. Based on the presented model, a convenient Excel-application called TASCV3.0 was developed for the practice. Such a practical computer-tool supports farmers in decision making concerning the tractor configuration, oriented to save fuel during agricultural operations.A soil-tyre interaction model simulated traction performance of tractors.Several traction test configurations on diverse textured soils validated the model.In most of the cases, simulations matched measured drawbar pull reliably.Tyre pressure, wheel load, and soil strength closely affect the traction performance.The model is adapted also in form of an implementation for the practice.Several models exist to simulate traction performance of a tractor, however, for most of them a proper experimental validation is missing.

897,Trading Activity and Macroeconomic Announcements in High-Frequency Exchange Rate Data,A. Chaboud;S. Chernenko;J. Wright,Journal of the European Economic Association,"This article introduces a new high-frequency data set that includes global trading volume and prices over five years in the spot euro-dollar and dollar-yen currency pairs. Studying the effects of US macroeconomic data releases, we show that spikes in trading volume tend to occur even when announcements are in line with market expectations, in sharp contrast to the price response. There is some evidence that the volume after announcements is negatively related to the ex ante dispersion of market expectations, contrary to the standard theoretical prediction. At very high frequency, we find evidence that much of the immediate jump in prices in reaction to an announcement occurs before the surge in volume."
898,Transcription termination by the eukaryotic RNA polymerase III,A. Arimbasseri;K. Rijal;R. Maraia,Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Gene Regulatory Mechanisms,"RNA polymerase (pol) III transcribes a multitude of tRNA and 5S rRNA genes as well as other small RNA genes distributed through the genome. By being sequence-specific, precise and efficient, transcription termination by pol III not only defines the 3′ end of the nascent RNA which directs subsequent association with the stabilizing La protein, it also prevents transcription into downstream DNA and promotes efficient recycling. Each of the RNA polymerases appears to have evolved unique mechanisms to initiate the process of termination in response to different types of termination signals. However, in eukaryotes much less is known about the final stage of termination, destabilization of the elongation complex with release of the RNA and DNA from the polymerase active center. By comparison to pols I and II, pol III exhibits the most direct coupling of the initial and final stages of termination, both of which occur at a short oligo(dT) tract on the non-template strand (dA on the template) of the DNA. While pol III termination is autonomous involving the core subunits C2 and probably C1, it also involves subunits C11, C37 and C53, which act on the pol III catalytic center and exhibit homology to the pol II elongation factor TFIIS and TFIIFα/β respectively. Here we compile knowledge of pol III termination and associate mutations that affect this process with structural elements of the polymerase that illustrate the importance of C53/37 both at its docking site on the pol III lobe and in the active center. The models suggest that some of these features may apply to the other eukaryotic pols. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Transcription by Odd Pols."
899,"Transcriptional Regulation: Effects of Promoter Proximal Pausing on Speed, Synchrony and Reliability",A. Boettiger;P. Ralph;S. Evans,PLOS Computational Biology,"Recent whole genome polymerase binding assays in the Drosophila embryo have shown that a substantial proportion of uninduced genes have pre-assembled RNA polymerase-II transcription initiation complex (PIC) bound to their promoters. These constitute a subset of promoter proximally paused genes for which mRNA elongation instead of promoter access is regulated. This difference can be described as a rearrangement of the regulatory topology to control the downstream transcriptional process of elongation rather than the upstream transcriptional initiation event. It has been shown experimentally that genes with the former mode of regulation tend to induce faster and more synchronously, and that promoter-proximal pausing is observed mainly in metazoans, in accord with a posited impact on synchrony. However, it has not been shown whether or not it is the change in the regulated step per se that is causal. We investigate this question by proposing and analyzing a continuous-time Markov chain model of PIC assembly regulated at one of two steps: initial polymerase association with DNA, or release from a paused, transcribing state. Our analysis demonstrates that, over a wide range of physical parameters, increased speed and synchrony are functional consequences of elongation control. Further, we make new predictions about the effect of elongation regulation on the consistent control of total transcript number between cells. We also identify which elements in the transcription induction pathway are most sensitive to molecular noise and thus possibly the most evolutionarily constrained. Our methods produce symbolic expressions for quantities of interest with reasonable computational effort and they can be used to explore the interplay between interaction topology and molecular noise in a broader class of biochemical networks. We provide general-purpose code implementing these methods."
900,Transcriptional regulation of phagocytosis-induced membrane biogenesis by sterol regulatory element binding proteins,A. Castoreno;Y. Wang;W. Stockinger;L. Jarzylo;H. Du;J. Pagnon;E. Shieh;A. Nohturfft,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) - Cell Biology,"In the process of membrane biogenesis several dozen proteins must operate in precise concert to generate ≈100 lipids at appropriate concentrations. To study the regulation of bilayer assembly in a cell cycle-independent manner, we have exploited the fact that phagocytes replenish membranes expended during particle engulfment in a rapid phase of lipid synthesis. In response to phagocytosis of latex beads, human embryonic kidney 293 cells synthesized cholesterol and phospholipids at amounts equivalent to the surface area of the internalized particles. Lipid synthesis was accompanied by increased transcription of several lipogenic proteins, including the low-density lipoprotein receptor, enzymes required for cholesterol synthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase), and fatty acid synthase. Phagocytosis triggered the proteolytic activation of two lipogenic transcription factors, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1a (SREBP-1a) and SREBP-2. Proteolysis of SREBPs coincided with the appearance of their transcriptionally active N termini in the nucleus and 3-fold activation of an SREBP-specific reporter gene. In previous studies with cultured cells, proteolytic activation of SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 has been observed in response to selective starvation of cells for cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids. However, under the current conditions, SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 are induced without lipid deprivation. SREBP activation is inhibited by high levels of the SREBP-interacting proteins Insig1 or the cytosolic domain of SREBP cleavage-activating protein. Upon overexpression of these proteins, phagocytosis-induced transcription and lipid synthesis were blocked. These results identify SREBPs as essential regulators of membrane biogenesis and provide a useful system for further studies on membrane homeostasis."
901,Transformation and action of extracellular NAD+ in perfused rat and mouse livers,A. Broetto-Biazon;F. Bracht;L. Bracht;A. Kelmer-Bracht;A. Bracht,Acta Pharmacologica Sinica,"Transformation and possible metabolic effects of extracellular NAD+ were investigated in the livers of mice (Mus musculus; Swiss strain) and rats (Rattus novergicus; Holtzman and Wistar strains).The livers were perfused in an open system using oxygen-saturated Krebs/Henseleit-bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) as the perfusion fluid. The transformation of NAD+ was monitored using high-performance liquid chromatography.In the mouse liver, the single-pass metabolism of 100 μmol/L NAD+ was almost complete; ADP-ribose and nicotinamide were the main products in the outflowing perfusate. In the livers of both Holtzman and Wistar rats, the main transformation products were ADP-ribose, uric acid and nicotinamide; significant amounts of inosine and AMP were also identified. On a weight basis, the transformation of NAD+ was more efficient in the mouse liver. In the rat liver, 100 μmol/L NAD+ transiently inhibited gluconeogenesis and oxygen uptake. Inhibition was followed by a transient stimulation. Inhibition was more pronounced in the Wistar strain and stimulation was more pronounced in the Holtzman strain. In the mouse liver, no clear effects on gluconeogenesis and oxygen uptake were found even at 500 μmol/L NAD+.It can be concluded that the functions of extracellular NAD+ are species-dependent and that observations in one species are strictly valid for that species. Interspecies extrapolations should thus be made very carefully. Actually, even variants of the same species can demonstrate considerably different responses.Transformation and possible metabolic effects of extracellular NAD+ were investigated in the livers of mice (Mus musculus; Swiss strain) and rats (Rattus novergicus; Holtzman and Wistar strains).The livers were perfused in an open system using oxygen-saturated Krebs/Henseleit-bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) as the perfusion fluid.

902,Transformation and actions of extracellular NADP+ in the rat liver,A. Broetto-Biazon;M. Kangussu;F. Padilha;F. Bracht;A. Kelmer-Bracht;A. Bracht,Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry,"The possible actions and transformation of extracellular NADP+ in the rat liver have not yet been studied. Considering the various effects of its analogue NAD+ in the liver, however, effects of NADP+ can equally be expected. In the present work, this question was approached in the isolated perfused rat liver to get a preliminary picture of the action of extracellular NADP+ in this organ. NADP+ (100 μM) produced transient increases in the portal perfusion pressure. Glucose release (glycogenolysis) and lactate production from endogenous glycogen were transiently increased in antegrade and retrograde perfusion. Oxygen uptake was stimulated after a transient inhibition in antegrade perfusion, which was practically absent in retrograde perfusion. Pyruvate production was transiently inhibited. In the absence of Ca2+, all of these effects were no longer observed. Bromophenacyl bromide, an inhibitor of eicosanoid synthesis, almost abolished all effects. Suramin, a non-specific purinergic P2YX antagonist, also inhibited the action of NADP+. Single pass transformation of 75 μM NADP+ was equal to 92%. Besides nicotinamide, at least two additional transformation products were detected: 2′-phospho-ADP-ribose and a non-identified component, the former being more important (67% of the transformed NADP+). Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) was not found in the outflowing perfusate. It was concluded that NADP+, like NAD+, acts on perfusion pressure and glycogen catabolism in the liver mainly via eicosanoid synthesis mediated by purinergic P2YX receptors."
903,Transformation of Leishmania mexicana metacyclic promastigotes to amastigote-like forms mediated by binding of human C-reactive protein,A. Bee;F. Culley;I. Alkhalife;K. Bodman-Smith;J. Raynes;P. Bates,Parasitology,"Infective metacyclic promastigote forms of Leishmania mexicana are introduced by the bite of sandfly vectors into their human hosts where they transform into the amastigote form. The kinetics of this process was examined in vitro in response to different combinations of temperature (26 °C or 32 °C), pH (7.2 or 5.5), and exposure to human serum. Little transformation occurred at 26 °C/pH 7.2, intermediate levels at 26 °C/pH 5.5 and 32 °C/ pH 7.2, and the greatest response at 32 °C/pH 5.5. Transformation was stimulated by exposure to normal human serum, but was markedly reduced when serum previously incubated at 56 °C for 1 h was used (complement heat-inactivated). This stimulatory effect was reproduced by exposure to a single purified component of human serum, C-reactive protein (CRP). Binding of CRP to the whole surface of L. mexicana metacyclic promastigotes, including the flagella, was demonstrated by an indirect fluorescent antibody test. The effect of purified CRP was dose dependent and occurred using normal serum concentrations. The stimulatory effect of whole serum was oblated by CRP depletion and restored by addition of purified CRP. The effects of cAMP analogues indicated that transformation could be mediated via an adenylate cyclase cascade."
904,Transformation products of extracellular NAD+ in the rat liver: kinetics of formation and metabolic action,A. Broetto-Biazon;F. Bracht;A. Sá-Nakanishi;C. Lopez;J. Constantin;A. Kelmer-Bracht;A. Bracht,Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry,"The perfused rat liver responds in several ways to NAD+ infusion (20–100 μM). Increases in portal perfusion pressure and glycogenolysis and transient inhibition of oxygen consumption and gluconeogenesis are some of the effects that were observed. Extracellular NAD+ is also extensively transformed in the liver. The purpose of the present work was to determine the main products of extracellular NAD+ transformation under various conditions and to investigate the possible contribution of these products for the metabolic effects of the parent compound. The experiments were done with the isolated perfused rat liver. The NAD+ transformation was monitored by HPLC. Confirming previous findings, the single-pass transformation of 100 μM NAD+ ranged between 75% at 1.5 min after starting infusion to 95% at 8 min. The most important products of single-pass NAD+ transformation appearing in the outflowing perfusate were nicotinamide, ADP-ribose, uric acid, and inosine. The relative proportions of these products presented some variations with the time after initiation of NAD+ infusion and the perfusion conditions, but ADP-ribose was always more abundant than uric acid and inosine. Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADP-ribose) as well as adenosine were not detected in the outflowing perfusate. The metabolic effects of ADP-ribose were essentially those already described for NAD+. These effects were sensitive to suramin (P2XY purinergic receptor antagonist) and insensitive to 3,7-dimethyl-1-(2-propargyl)-xanthine (A2 purinergic receptor antagonist). Inosine, a known purinergic A3 agonist, was also active on metabolism, but uric acid and nicotinamide were inactive. It was concluded that the metabolic and hemodynamic effects of extracellular NAD+ are caused mainly by interactions with purinergic receptors with a highly significant participation of its main transformation product ADP-ribose."
905,Translational and rotational dynamic analysis of a superconducting levitation system,A. Cansiz;J. Hull;Ö. Gundogdu,Superconductor Science and Technology,"The rotational dynamics of a disc-shaped permanent magnet rotor levitated over a high temperature superconductor was studied experimentally and theoretically. The interaction between the rotor magnet and the superconductor was modelled by assuming the magnet to be a magnetic dipole and the superconductor a diamagnet. In the magnetomechanical analysis of the superconductor part, the frozen image concept was combined with the diamagnetic image, and the damping in the system was neglected. The interaction potential of the system is the combination of magnetic and gravitational potentials. From the dynamical analysis the equations of motion of the permanent magnet were stated as a function of lateral, vertical, tilt, precision and rotating angles. The vibration behaviour and correlation of the vibration of one direction with that of another were determined with a numerical calculation based on the Runge–Kutta method. The various vibrational frequencies identified were vertical, radial, tilt, precession and rotation. The tests performed for experimental verifications were translational and rotational. The permanent magnet was 'spun up' under vacuum conditions to analyse the dynamics of the free 'spin down' behaviour of the permanent magnet."
906,Transmission parameters of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis infections in a dairy herd going through a control program,A. Benedictus;R. Mitchell;M. Linde-Widmann;R. Sweeney;R. Whitlock,Preventive Veterinary Medicine,"A Johne's disease control program, including stringent management practices and a test-and-cull program (whole-herd fecal-samples taken twice a year), was implemented on a medium-sized Pennsylvania dairy farm that was suffering losses from clinical Johne's disease. The data that emerged from the control program, combined with birthdates, culling dates, lactation information and pedigrees, yielded an extensive longitudinal dataset. The dataset was processed through SAS 9.1 for statistical analysis; herd-level disease dynamics and dam-to-daughter transmission parameters were calculated. After the implementation of the program in 1984, prevalence dropped dramatically from 60% to less than 20% in 1989. After an apparent prevalence peak (25%) in 1991 due to improved test sensitivity, prevalence maintained a plateau of 10% from 1996 to 2000. After the implementation of the program, 9.5% of the offspring from test-negative dams and 26.8% of the offspring from known-infected dams became infected with Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Map) (χ2 = 14.7; p = 0.0001). Calves born shortly following the calving of an infected dam and calves growing up with a future high shedder were more likely to be infected compared to calves without this risk profile. It was concluded that, after the implementation of the control program, the most important causes of infections of susceptible calves were their own dams or infected animals which had calved recently."
907,Treatment for opioid use and outcomes in older adults: a systematic literature review,A. Carew;C. Comiskey,Drug and Alcohol Dependence,"Historically, issues relating to problem substance use among older people have received little attention, and have only recently been recognised.A literature review of relevant material was conducted in November 2015 to assess current outcome research among older adults treated for opioid dependence. Multiple electronic databases were searched and results were supplemented by grey literature, library and online searches, and relevant references within selected articles. Retrieved articles were assessed for relevance against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results were reviewed to identify major findings and recommendations.A total of 76 titles were included in the review. Most research conducted on older adults involves alcohol and prescription medications. Older drug users are growing in number and have a unique profile, with many presenting for treatment for the first time aged 50–70 years. Findings reveal (1) opioid treatment numbers are decreasing, however the average age of treatment admissions is increasing, (2) there is no consensus on what old is (3) two distinct types of older opioid substance users exist (early/late onset), (4) older clients achieve better treatment outcomes than younger counterparts, and (5) older women achieve better treatment outcomes than men.Findings suggest that little is known about treatment outcomes among older people. Problematic drug use (of which opioids make up the largest proportion) had been incorrectly assumed to end as patients age. Defining an age limit for ‘older’ is important. Addiction and healthcare services must anticipate and prepare for increased demand by this group."
908,"Tree Planting by Smallholder Farmers in the Upper Catchment of Lake Tana Watershed, Northwest Ethiopia",A. Abiyu;D. Teketay;G. Gratzer;M. Shete,Small-scale Forestry,"Tree growing by smallholder farmers is an emerging livelihood strategy in Lake Tana catchment. The objectives of this study were to (1) identify the most important tree species grown, (2) investigate the drivers of the existing pattern, and (3) identify determinants of the number and diversity of tree species and their spatial patterns. Survey data were collected from 200 households. Multiple linear regression was employed to identify the determinants of tree growing behaviour of households and spatial variables affecting the abundance of tree species. Eucalyptus globulus, Acacia decurrens and E. camaldulensis dominate woodlots. Only a fraction of the forest production is used by the households, the rest being sold as poles or charcoal. Location in relation to market centres, number of livestock owned, landholding size and age of household head were found to positively affected the number of tree species and trees grown. Gender affected the species and spatial pattern of trees. Woodlots, farm boundaries and homesteads were found to be important tree growing niches. These results substantiate the proposition that farmers assign their parcels of land to uses that increase the rent value of the land, and this value is affected by access to roads. Woodlots are on the increase at the cost of productive agricultural land. Provision of a tree planting extension service may increase participation of farmers in tree planting, and a management-oriented tree planting extension service may give desirable results."
909,Tree-ring evidence of 'Little Ice Age' glacier advances in southern Tibet,A. Bräuning,Holocene,"The history of late Holocene glacier fluctuations in eastern Tibet was studied by determining the ages of trees growing on glacier deposits. Maximum tree ages yield minimum ages of AD 1760 and 1780 for moraine formation at the maximum extent of the ‘Little Ice Age’ glacier advances in two glacier forefields. Subsequent moraines could be dated to the beginning of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century. Larch trees from a third glacier forefield in southeastern Tibet show evidence of glacier activity from 1580 to 1590, from the end of the eighteenth to the beginning of the nineteenth century and from 1860 to 1880. One glacier at Mt Gyalaperi recently advanced in both 1951 and 1987. Periods of glacier advances can partly be correlated with periods of growth reductions in chronologies of total ring width and maximum latewood density derived from trees growing on slopes above the glacier valleys. Correlation functions with meteorological data suggest that maximum latewood density of subalpine Picea balfouriana, Larix griffithii and Abies delavayi var. motouensis is positively correlated with summer temperature, while ring width of these species and of subalpine Juniperus tibetica is also sensitive to winter conditions prior to the growing season."
910,Tree-ring record in Ethiopian church forests reveals successive generation differences in growth rates and disturbance events,A. Abiyu;M. Mokria;A. Gebrekirstos;A. Bräuning,Forest Ecology and Management,"Forests provide fundamental ecosystem services. Environmental changes are predicted to affect forest growth directly through increased environmental stressors, and indirectly by amplifying disturbance. To increase our understanding of effects of environmental changes and disturbance on Afromontane forest growth, we used tree-ring data collected from Juniperus procera trees from church forests in the northwest highlands of Ethiopia. We used structural change models to detect structural shift in growth trends. We applied Linear Mixed Effect Models (LMM) to compare growth rate differences between successive tree generations. The running mean method and radial growth pattern analysis were used to detect disturbance events. Three groups of generations were identified based on Basal Area Increment (BAI) rates. There are significant differences (χ2 = 204.64, P &lt; .001) among generations in pace of BAI, indicating that old generation trees grew at a slower pace than younger ones. Radial growth patterns were homogeneous for the old generation, but diverse in young trees. The observed high growth rates in the younger generation may have a negative effect on the longevity of the individuals and positively affect carbon accumulation in the biomass. Disturbance was detected in all generations, but worsened in the 20th century. About 35% of disturbances matched with climate extreme events, providing evidence that the disturbance is both human-induced (i.e., site-specific) and climate-induced. Thus, forest management plans should emerge from a sound understanding of climate-forest-human interaction.Junipures procera from sacred Ethiopian church forests forms distinct annual growth rings.Growth rate and pattern significantly varied across tree generations.One-third of disturbances are related to climate events, others to human activity.Disturbance frequency increased in the 20th century.Forests provide fundamental ecosystem services.

911,"Triggering factors of landslides in Campos do Jordão city, Brazil",A. Ahrendt;L. Zuquette,Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment,"This paper focuses on the identification and analysis of the mechanisms and triggering factors of some landslides which have occurred in Campos de Jordão city, Brazil. The methodological procedures were based mainly on the recognition of the weathering profiles, recording of the landslide features, elaboration of the map of unconsolidated materials and slope and mass flow direction charts. In addition, an analysis of the rainfall data of the last 23 years was carried out. The translational type was the most common landslide that occurred, with failure surfaces between the sandy silt and sandy clay layers. Most landslides occurred in areas with slopes steeper than 30°. The rainfall data analyzed also showed that the distribution is a more important triggering factor than the amount of precipitation, such that landslides occur preferentially in the period from December to January. Cet article présente une analyse des processus et des facteurs déclenchants relatifs à quelques glissements de terrain qui ont eu lieu dans la ville de Campos de Jordao au Brésil. La méthodologie mise en ɶuvre a conduit à identifier les caractéristiques des glissements de terrain, caractériser des profils d'altération, élaborer une carte des matériaux sous-consolidés, une carte des pentes et des directions de propagation d'écoulements. Le glissement plan est le type de glissement le plus représenté, avec des surfaces de rupture au contact des couches de silts sableaux et d'argiles sableuses. La plupart des glissements de terrain ont eu lieu dans des régions présentant des pentes supérieures à 30°. De plus, une analyse des données pluviométriques des vingt-trois dernières années a été réalisée. Cette analyse a montré que la période des pluies représente un facteur déclenchant plus important que le total des précipitations, de sorte que les glissements de terrain ont lieu préférentiellement de décembre à janvier."
912,Triply coupled vibrations of thin-walled open cross-section beams including rotary inertia effects,A. Arpaci;S. Bozdag;E. Sunbuloglu,Journal of Sound and Vibration,"An exact analytical method is presented for predicting the undamped natural frequencies of beams with thin-walled open cross-sections having no axis of symmetry. The governing differential equations give a characteristic equation of the 12th order with real coefficients. The roots are found numerically and the exact boundary conditions are considered especially for free ends to obtain natural frequencies. The simpler cases of neglecting cross-sectional warping and/or rotary inertia are also dealt with. It is seen that when the effect of rotary inertia is neglected significant errors incur for some boundary conditions, cross-section thicknesses and mode numbers. This is more profound when the warping effect is taken into account.An exact analytical method is presented for predicting the undamped natural frequencies of beams with thin-walled open cross-sections having no axis of symmetry.

Laitman,The Anatomical Record,"Our prior work suggested that petro‐occipital fissure (POF) ossification may be altered in clinicopathologies of the cranial base such as hearing loss (Balboni et al., 2005). Here we demonstrate an accelerated and statistically significant ossification of the POF and cochlear aqueduct (CA) in a historical population of patients diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB). While a number of studies have sought to reduce the importance of the POF/CA to hearing, given its anatomical location, evolutionary conservation across mammals and the mounting data linking morphological changes of the POF/CA to the temporal onset of hearing loss and tinnitus, it is becoming difficult to maintain that its function is not related to inner ear homeostasis.

915,Two-dimensional superconductivity in the cuprates revealed by atomic-layer-by-layer molecular beam epitaxy,A. Bollinger;I. Božović,Superconductor Science and Technology,"Various electronic phases displayed by cuprates that exhibit high temperature superconductivity continue to attract much interest. We provide a short review of several experiments that we have performed aimed at investigating the superconducting state in these compounds. Measurements on single-phase films, bilayers, and superlattices all point to the conclusion that the high-temperature superconductivity (HTS) in these materials is an essentially quasi-two dimensional phenomenon. With proper control over the film growth, HTS can exist in a single copper oxide plane with the critical temperatures as high as that achieved in the bulk samples."
916,Two-tailed approximate confidence intervals for the ratio of proportions,A. Andrés;M. Hernández,Statistics and Computing,"Various approximate methods have been proposed for obtaining a two-tailed confidence interval for the ratio R of two proportions (independent samples). This paper evaluates 73 different methods (64 of which are new methods or modifications of older methods) and concludes that: (1) none of the classic methods (including the well-known score method) is acceptable since they are too liberal; (2), the best of the classic methods is the one based on logarithmic transformation (after increasing the data by 0.5), but it is only valid for large samples and moderate values of R; (3) the best methods among the 73 methods is based on an approximation to the score method (after adding 0.5 to all the data), with the added advantage of obtaining the interval by a simple method (i.e. solving a second degree equation); and (4) an option that is simpler than the previous one, and which is almost as effective for moderate values of R, consists of applying the classic Wald method (after adding a quantity to the data which is usually \(z_{\alpha /2}^{2}/4\))."
917,Ultrasensitive interplay between ferromagnetism and superconductivity in NbGd composite thin films,A. Bawa;A. Gupta;S. Singh;V. Awana;S. Sahoo,Scientific Reports (Physics),"A model binary hybrid system composed of a randomly distributed rare-earth ferromagnetic (Gd) part embedded in an s-wave superconducting (Nb) matrix is being manufactured to study the interplay between competing superconducting and ferromagnetic order parameters. The normal metallic to superconducting phase transition appears to be very sensitive to the magnetic counterpart and the modulation of the superconducing properties follow closely to the Abrikosov-Gor’kov (AG) theory of magnetic impurity induced pair breaking mechanism. A critical concentration of Gd is obtained for the studied NbGd based composite films (CFs) above which superconductivity disappears. Besides, a magnetic ordering resembling the paramagnetic Meissner effect (PME) appears in DC magnetization measurements at temperatures close to the superconducting transition temperature. The positive magnetization related to the PME emerges upon doping Nb with Gd. The temperature dependent resistance measurements evolve in a similar fashion with the concentration of Gd as that with an external magnetic field and in both the cases, the transition curves accompany several intermediate features indicating the traces of magnetism originated either from Gd or from the external field. Finally, the signatures of magnetism appear evidently in the magnetization and transport measurements for the CFs with very low (<1 at.%) doping of Gd.A model binary hybrid system composed of a randomly distributed rare-earth ferromagnetic (Gd) part embedded in an s-wave superconducting (Nb) matrix is being manufactured to study the interplay between competing superconducting and ferromagnetic order parameters.

918,Ultrasound and slightly acid electrolyzed water application: An efficient combination to reduce the bacterial counts of chicken breast during pre-chilling,A. Cichoski;D. Flores;C. Menezes;E. Jacob-Lopes;P. Campagnol,International Journal of Food Microbiology,"Pre-chilling leads to a temperature decline of the pre-rigor muscle of poultry carcasses, and a reduction of the initial bacterial load may occur. Both ultrasound (US) and slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) have been used alone in the meat industry for the manufacture of emulsions, pasteurization, and prevention of bacteria growth. However, the impact of the combination of these technologies during the pre-chilling of chicken carcasses has not been evaluated. In this study, breast chicken cylinders (CBCs) were pre-chilled for 10 min at 10 °C using SAEW and different US frequencies (25 and 130 kHz). The microbiological characteristics, lipid and protein oxidation, shear force, and anaerobic glycolysis were evaluated. The US + SAEW combination led to an effective reduction (P &lt; 0.05) of enterobacteria, mesophilic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, and psychrotrophic bacteria, while the lipid and protein oxidation, shear force, anaerobic glycolysis, and muscle structure were not affected (P &gt; 0.05). Therefore, the combination of these technologies may be promising in the pre-chilling stage of chicken carcasses."

Morgiel,Journal of Alloys and Compounds,"The effect of ultrasound (US) agitation (at different intensities of US from 0 to 40 Wcm−2) on the electrodeposition of Ni-Mo and Ni (as reference) coatings from an aqueous complex citrate–ammonia electrolyte was investigated. Increased US intensity has a meaningful influence on Mo content in Ni-Mo alloys, which vary from about 14.5 wt% to 19.5 wt%. Enrichment of alloys in Mo resulted in the refinement of the microstructure (crystallite size below 10 nm), and the enhancement of coatings' microhardness (from about 720 to 820 HV) and corrosion properties in chloride media (3.5% NaCl). The opposite effect was observed for Ni coatings, where US agitation did not significantly change the efficiency of Ni electrodeposition, phase composition and crystallite size (about 14 nm) of coatings, which led to the same microhardness values (about 700 HV) of the deposits in the whole range of the US intensities. Obtained results confirmed that US agitation applied during electrodeposition mainly acts as an additional factor affecting the hydrodynamic condition of the process, reducing the diffusion layer thickness and influences kinetics of the Mo reduction controlled by diffusion. Thus, increased US intensities in the analysed range (20–40 Wcm−2), resulting in increased Mo content in Ni-Mo alloys, directly influences their functional properties.The effect of US intensity on Ni-Mo composition and properties was studied.Deposition of Ni coatings from citrate-ammonia bath is not dependent on applied US.US agitation affects the kinetic of Ni-Mo deposition, resulting in increased Mo content.Structural and mechanical properties of alloys are strictly correlated with Mo content.The effect of ultrasound (US) agitation (at different intensities of US from 0 to 40 Wcm−2) on the electrodeposition of Ni-Mo and Ni (as reference) coatings from an aqueous complex citrate–ammonia electrolyte was investigated.

920,Ultrasound-assisted post-packaging pasteurization of sausages,A. Cichoski;C. Rampelotto;M. Silva;H. Moura;J. Barin,Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies,"Ultrasound (US) is proposed to reduce temperature and accelerate the process of pasteurization of packaged hot dog sausages. They were pasteurized in an ultrasonic bath (25 kHz, 200 W) for 10.53 min at 74 °C with (US) and without ultrasound (WUS) and also with conventional pasteurization (CT, water bath at 82 °C, 16 min to reach 73 °C inside of sausages). The temperature was 3.9 °C higher inside of pasteurized sausages using US in comparison to WUS. Sausages were stored by 60 days and physico-chemical and microbiological parameters were evaluated. US treatment inhibited the growth of psychrotrophic and lactic bacteria, reduced the lipid oxidation and promoted little pH and texture modifications during storage, improving the pasteurization. However, no information are available about the possible generation of toxic substances after US processing and further investigations must be carried out before the industrial scale-up of the process.An improvement on the effect of pasteurization of packaged sausages could be obtained by the use of ultrasound, reducing the time and the temperature used in conventional process and improving the shelf life of product without changes in its physical and chemical characteristics. The adaptation of the proposed process is relatively simple to be performed in conventional equipment used in industry and has potential for continuous processing and scale up. Because no information are available about the possible generation of toxic substances after the US processing, further investigations must be carried out before the industrial scale-up of the process."
921,Ultrasound: A promising technology to improve the technological quality of meat emulsions,A. Cichoski;M. Silva;Y. Leães;C. Brasil;P. Campagnol,Meat Science,"The use of ultrasound (US) has proven to be an effective tool in the preparation of emulsions. However, the cavitation phenomenon leads to an increase in temperature, which can affect the emulsion stability and the texture. Thus, different US operating modes (degas, normal, and sweep) were applied in meat emulsions for 5.5 min, at 25 kHz frequency and 60% amplitude, and the temperature behavior, yield, emulsion stability, texture, and lipid and protein oxidation were evaluated. The results showed that the wave propagation mode in the US bath exerts a great influence on the increase of temperature of meat emulsions. The distribution of cavitation in normal operating mode significantly favored (P &lt; .001) a higher yield (88.7%) and emulsion stability, with good values of cohesiveness (0.76), hardness (26.9 N), and chewiness (26.1 N), not increasing lipid and protein oxidation. Therefore, this study has proven that that the use of normal US operating mode improved the technological quality of meat emulsions."
922,Uncertain T-S model-based robust controller design with D-stability constraints—A simulation study of quadrotor attitude stabilization,A. Cherifi;K. Guelton;L. Arcese,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,"The problem of the attitude stabilization of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle is considered in simulation. An uncertain-like Takagi–Sugeno model of the quadrotor, where the nonlinear entries which depend on the input motor voltages are reported in uncertainties, is proposed to avoid closed-loop algebraic loops. The design of a Parallel Distributed Compensation (PDC) control law is considered with D-stability constraints in order to improve the closed-loop transient response. In this context, new generic and relaxed Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) conditions are proposed. These new PDC controller design conditions constitute an alternative to previously proposed D-stabilizing non-PDC controller ones. Indeed, non-PDC controllers require online inversions of time-varying matrices, which is a major drawback for embedded applications with low computational capabilities. The conservatism of the proposed LMI conditions with respect to previous results is illustrated through an academic example. Then, simulations of the quadrotor with usual prescribed LMI regions are proposed to show the effectiveness of the proposed conditions.The problem of the attitude stabilization of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle is considered in simulation.

923,Uncertainty in finite planes,A. Biro;V.

The ""baseline"" of our investigation is the well-known Meshulam's bound, which we sharpen, for the particular groups under consideration, taking into account not only the sizes of the support sets $\mathrm{supp}\,f$ and $\mathrm{supp}\,\hat f$, but also their structure. Our results imply in particular that, with some explicitly classified exceptions, one has $|\mathrm{supp}\,f||\mathrm{supp}\,\hat f|\ge3p(p-2)$; in comparison, the classical uncertainty inequality gives $|\mathrm{supp}\,f||\mathrm{supp}\,\hat f|\ge p^2$."
924,Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of thermoacoustic stability with non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion,A. Avdonin;S. Jaensch;C. Silva;M. Češnovar;W. Polifke,Combustion and Flame,"In this paper, non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion (NIPCE) is used for forward uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of thermoacoustic stability of two premixed flame configurations. The first configuration is a turbulent swirl combustor, modeled by the Helmholtz equation with an n−τ flame model. Uncertain input parameters are the gain and the time delay of the flame, as well as the magnitude and the phase of the outlet reflection coefficient. NIPCE is successfully validated against Monte Carlo simulation. It is observed that the first order expansion suffices to yield accurate results. The second configuration under investigation is a low order network model of a laminar slit burner, with the flame transfer function identified from weakly compressible CFD simulations of laminar reacting flow. Firstly the uncertainty and sensitivity of the growth rate due to three uncertain input parameters of the CFD model – i.e., flow velocity, burner plate temperature and equivalence ratio – are analyzed. A Monte Carlo simulation is no longer possible due to the computational cost of the CFD simulations. Secondly, two additional uncertain parameters are taken into account, i.e., the respective magnitudes of inlet and outlet reflection coefficients. This extension of the analysis does not entail a considerable increase in computational cost, since the additional parameters are included only in the low order network model. In both cases, the second order expansion is sufficient to model the uncertainties in growth rate."
925,"Uncovered interest parity: it works, but not for long",A. Chaboud;J. Wright,Journal of International Economics,"If an investor borrows in a low interest currency and invests in a high interest currency, the interest differential accrues in a lumpy manner, formally just like the dividend payments on a stock. The investor will receive the interest differential discretely at the point when a position is rolled over from one day to the next. A position that is not held open overnight receives no interest differential because intradaily interest rates are zero. Using a large data set of intradaily exchange rate data, we run uncovered interest parity (UIP) regressions over different short time intervals taking careful account of the settlement rules in the spot foreign exchange market. We find results that are supportive of the uncovered interest parity hypothesis over very short windows of data that span the time of the discrete interest payment. However, adding even a few hours to the span of the window destroys the positive uncovered interest parity results."
926,Undergraduate students' perceptions of a tour-guiding career,A. Aloudat,Scandinavian Journal of Hospitality and Tourism,"While tourism as an academic major has been taught for decades in tertiary institutions across the world, few studies have explored the perceptions of undergraduate tourism students on tourism careers. In specific, no study has investigated the perceptions of students on guiding career. Thus, this study sought to explore the perceptions of Jordanian undergraduate students majoring in Tour Guiding. To measure students’ perceptions, a structured questionnaire was employed. The responses revealed that the students considered tour guiding as a potentially interesting career that allows a degree of autonomy, while offering the opportunity to gain new knowledge and meet foreign and famous people. However, the students considered it is difficult to ensure a stable income in tour guiding, but thought that tipping and commissions are important sources of income for tour guides. They perceived that a tour-guiding career is highly regarded by their families and the wider community in Jordan. Research indicated that office-based permanent job careers are more respected by the general public than freelance careers. The results show the students’ awareness of the diversity of tour-guiding roles including promoters of their country, cultural mediators and positive influencers of tourist behaviour."
927,Understanding Perceptions of Racism in the Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina: The Roles of System and Group Justification,A. Blodorn;L. O'Brien;S. Cheryan;S. Vick,Social Justice Research,"The present study examined perceptions of racism in events that occurred during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina among a community sample of New Orleans area residents. Drawing on system justification theory, we examined system justification motives (i.e., meritocracy beliefs) and group justification motives (i.e., group identity) as predictors of perceptions of racism among African Americans and European Americans. Compared to African Americans, European Americans perceived much lower levels of racism in Katrina-related events. Furthermore, meritocracy beliefs were negatively related to perceptions of racism among both African Americans and European Americans. However, private regard (a component of group identity) was positively related to perceptions of racism among African Americans, but negatively related to perceptions of racism among European Americans. The results suggest that both system and group justification motives independently predict perceptions of racism in an important real-world event. Furthermore, system and group justification motives appear to operate in opposition for African Americans, but in tandem for European Americans."
928,Understanding Profiles of Preservice Teachers With Different Levels of Commitment to Teaching in Urban Schools,A. Aragon;S. Culpepper;M. Mckee;M. Perkins,Urban Education,Understanding the beliefs of preservice teachers is an important area to investigate in the teacher education process. This article examines the relationship between preservice teachers’ beliefs pertaining to diversity and urban schooling and how these inclinations contribute to a commitment to teaching urban students. Canonical correlation analysis was used to identify profiles of preservice teachers who exhibited varying degrees of interest to teach in urban schools. The statistical analysis provides a range of positive and negative attitudinal inclinations toward urban teaching. It is important to examine preservice teacher beliefs to benefit students in urban schools especially in light of prevailing teacher attrition.
929,Understanding the Canadian oil sands industry's greenhouse gas emissions,A. Charpentier;J. Bergerson;H. Maclean,Environmental Research Letters,"The magnitude of Canada's oil sands reserves, their rapidly expanding and energy intensive production, combined with existing and upcoming greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions regulations motivate an evaluation of oil sands-derived fuel production from a life cycle perspective. Thirteen studies of GHG emissions associated with oil sands operations are reviewed. The production of synthetic crude oil (SCO) through surface mining and upgrading (SM&Up) or in situ and upgrading (IS&Up) processes is reported to result in emissions ranging from 62 to 164 and 99 to 176 kgCO2eq/bbl SCO, respectively (or 9.2–26.5 and 16.2–28.7 gCO2eq MJ−1 SCO, respectively), compared to 27–58 kgCO2eq/bbl (4.5–9.6 gCO2eq MJ−1) of crude for conventional oil production. The difference in emissions intensity between SCO and conventional crude production is primarily due to higher energy requirements for extracting bitumen and upgrading it into SCO. On a 'well-to-wheel' basis, GHG emissions associated with producing reformulated gasoline from oil sands with current SM&Up, IS&Up, and in situ (without upgrading) technologies are 260–320, 320–350, and 270–340 gCO2eq km−1, respectively, compared to 250–280 gCO2eq km−1 for production from conventional oil. Some variation between studies is expected due to differences in methods, technologies studied, and operating choices. However, the magnitude of the differences presented suggests that a consensus on the characterization of life cycle emissions of the oil sands industry has yet to be reached in the public literature. Recommendations are given for future studies for informing industry and government decision making."
930,"Unexpected CO Dependencies, Catalyst Speciation, and Single Turnover Hydrogenolysis Studies of Hydroformylation via High Pressure NMR Spectroscopy",A. Brezny;C. Landis,Journal of the American Chemical Society,"Rhodium bis(diazaphospholane) (BDP) catalyzed hydroformylation of styrene is sensitive to CO concentration, and drastically different kinetic regimes are affected by modest changes in gas pressure. The Wisconsin High Pressure NMR Reactor (WiHP-NMRR) has enabled the observation of changes in catalyst speciation in these different regimes. The apparent discrepancy between catalyst speciation and product distribution led us to report the first direct, noncatalytic quantitative observation of hydrogenolysis of acyl dicarbonyls. Analysis and modeling of these experiments show that not all catalyst is shunted through the off-cycle intermediates and this contributes to the drastic mismatch in selectivities. The data herein highlight the complex kinetics of Rh(BDP) catalyzed hydroformylation. In this case, the complexity arises from competing kinetic and thermodynamic preferences involving formation and isomerization of the acyl mono- and dicarbonyl intermediates and their hydrogenolysis to give aldehydes."
931,Universal off-diagonal long-range order behaviour for a trapped Tonks-Girardeau gas,A. Colcelli;J. Viti;G. Mussardo;A. Trombettoni,ArXiv Physics,"The scaling of the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ of the one-body density matrix of a system with respect to its particle number $N$ defines an exponent $\mathcal{C}$ and a coefficient $\mathcal{B}$ via the asymptotic relation $\lambda_0 \sim \mathcal{B}\,N^{\mathcal{C}}$. The case $\mathcal{C}=1$ corresponds to off-diagonal long-range order. For a one-dimensional homogeneous Tonks-Girardeau gas, a well known result also confirmed by bosonization gives instead $\mathcal{C}=1/2$. Here we investigate the inhomogeneous case, initially addressing the behaviour of $\mathcal{C}$ in presence of a general external trapping potential $V$. We argue that the value $\mathcal{C}= 1/2$ characterises the hard-core system independently of the nature of the potential $V$. We then define the exponents $\gamma$ and $\beta$ which describe the scaling with $N$ of the peak of the momentum distribution and the natural orbital corresponding to $\lambda_0$ respectively, and we derive the scaling relation $\gamma + 2\beta= \mathcal{C}$. Taking as a specific case the power-law potential $V(x)\propto x^{2n}$, we give analytical formulas for $\gamma$ and $\beta$ as functions of $n$. Analytical predictions for the coefficient $\mathcal{B}$ are also obtained. These formulas are derived exploiting a recent field theoretical formulation and checked against numerical results. The agreement is excellent."
932,Unpacking the psychological weight of weight stigma: A rejection-expectation pathway,A. Blodorn;B. Major;J. Hunger;C. Miller,Journal of Experimental Social Psychology,"The present research tested the hypothesis that the negative effects of weight stigma among higher body-weight individuals are mediated by expectations of social rejection. Women and men who varied in objective body-weight (body mass index; BMI) gave a speech describing why they would make a good date. Half believed that a potential dating partner would see a videotape of their speech (weight seen) and half believed that a potential dating partner would listen to an audiotape of their speech (weight unseen). Among women, but not men, higher body-weight predicted increased expectations of social rejection, decreased executive control resources, decreased self-esteem, increased self-conscious emotions and behavioral displays of self-consciousness when weight was seen but not when weight was unseen. As predicted, higher body-weight women reported increased expectations of social rejection when weight was seen (versus unseen), which in turn predicted decreased self-esteem, increased self-conscious emotions, and increased stress. In contrast, lower body-weight women reported decreased expectations of social rejection when weight was seen (versus unseen), which in turn predicted increased self-esteem, decreased self-conscious emotions, and decreased stress. Men's responses were largely unaffected by body-weight or visibility, suggesting that a dating context may not be identity threatening for higher body-weight men. Overall, the present research illuminates a rejection-expectation pathway by which weight stigma undermines higher body-weight women's health.Tested a rejection-expectation pathway underlying harmful effects of weight stigmaWomen and men gave a dating speech while their weight was seen (vs. unseen).Higher BMI women anticipated rejection, leading to negative psychological effects.Lower BMI women anticipated acceptance, leading to positive psychological effects.Men were largely unaffected by having their weight seen during the dating speech.The present research tested the hypothesis that the negative effects of weight stigma among higher body-weight individuals are mediated by expectations of social rejection. Women and men who varied in objective body-weight (body mass index; BMI) gave a speech describing why they would make a good date. Half believed that a potential dating partner would see a videotape of their speech (weight seen) and half believed that a potential dating partner would listen to an audiotape of their speech (weight unseen). Among women, but not men, higher body-weight predicted increased expectations of social rejection, decreased executive control resources, decreased self-esteem, increased self-conscious emotions and behavioral displays of self-consciousness when weight was seen but not when weight was unseen. As predicted, higher body-weight women reported increased expectations of social rejection when weight was seen (versus unseen), which in turn predicted decreased self-esteem, increased self-conscious emotions, and increased stress. In contrast, lower body-weight women reported decreased expectations of social rejection when weight was seen (versus unseen), which in turn predicted increased self-esteem, decreased self-conscious emotions, and decreased stress. Men's responses were largely unaffected by body-weight or visibility, suggesting that a dating context may not be identity threatening for higher body-weight men. Overall, the present research illuminates a rejection-expectation pathway by which weight stigma undermines higher body-weight women's health."
933,Unsupervised Cross-lingual Representation Learning at Scale,A. Conneau;K. Khandelwal;N. Goyal;V. Chaudhary;G. Wenzek;F. Guzmán;E. Grave;M. Ott;L. Zettlemoyer;V. Stoyanov,ArXiv Computer Science,"This paper shows that pretraining multilingual language models at scale leads to significant performance gains for a wide range of cross-lingual transfer tasks. We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +13.8% average accuracy on XNLI, +12.3% average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.1% average F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 11.8% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 9.2% for Urdu over the previous XLM model. We also present a detailed empirical evaluation of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing per-language performance; XLM-Ris very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We will make XLM-R code, data, and models publicly available."
934,"Unusual Oxidation of Phosphines Employing Water as the Oxygen Atom Source and Tris(benzene-1,2-dithiolate)molybdenum(VI) as the Oxidant. A Functional Molybdenum Hydroxylase Analogue System",A. Cervilla;F. Pérez-Pla;E. Llopis;M. Piles,Inorganic Chemistry,"The kinetics of the reaction of MoVI(S2C6H4)3 with organic phosphines to produce the anionic Mo(V) complex, MoV(S2C6H4)3-, and phosphine oxide have been investigated. Reaction rates, monitored by UV−vis stopped-flow spectrophotometry, were studied in THF/H2O media as a function of the concentration of phosphine, molybdenum complex, pH, and water concentration. The reaction exhibits pH-dependent phosphine saturation kinetics and is first-order in complex concentration. The water concentration strongly enhances the reaction rate, which is consistent with the formation of MoVI(S2C6H4)3(H2O) adduct as a crucial intermediate. The observed pH dependence of the reaction rate would arise from the distribution between acid and basic forms of this adduct. Apparently, the electrophilic attack by the phosphine at the oxygen requires the coordinated water to be in the unprotonated hydroxide form, MoVI(S2C6H4)3(HO)-. This is followed by the concerted abstraction of 2e-, H+ by the Mo(VI) center to give MoIV(S2C6H4)32-, H+, and the corresponding phosphine oxide. However, this Mo(IV) complex product is oxidized rapidly to MoV(S2C6H4)3- via comproportionation with unreacted MoVI(S2C6H4)3. The Mo(V) complex thus formed can be oxidized to the starting Mo(VI) complex upon admission of O2. Consequently, MoVI(S2C6H4)3 is a catalyst for the autoxidation of phosphines in the presence of water. Additionally, there was a detectable variation in the reactivity for a series of tertiary phosphines. The rate of Mo(VI) complex reduction increases as does the phosphine basicity: (p-CH3C6H4)3P > (C6H5)3P > (p-ClC6H4)3P. Oxygen isotope tracing confirms that water rather than dioxygen is the source of the oxygen atom which is transferred to the phosphine. Such reactivity parallels oxidase activity of xanthine enzyme with phosphine as oxygen atom acceptor and MoVI(S2C6H4)3 as electron acceptor."
935,Upper and lower bounds on generalized scattering lengths,A. Arthurs;C. Coles,Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical,Upper and lower bounds on generalized scattering lengths for static potentials are presented. Their derivation is based on complementary variational principles for a certain class of linear operator equations. Generalized forms of the well-known bounds of Schwinger and of Spruch and Rosenberg are obtained from this approach together with related complementary bounds which are new. The results are illustrated with calculations for screened Coulomb potentials.

Pentland,ArXiv Computer Science,"Modern cities are growing ecosystems that face new challenges due to the increasing population demands. One of the many problems they face nowadays is waste management, which has become a pressing issue requiring new solutions. Swarm robotics systems have been attracting an increasing amount of attention in the past years and they are expected to become one of the main driving factors for innovation in the field of robotics. The research presented in this paper explores the feasibility of a swarm robotics system in an urban environment. By using bio-inspired foraging methods such as multi-place foraging and stigmergy-based navigation, a swarm of robots is able to improve the efficiency and autonomy of the urban waste management system in a realistic scenario. To achieve this, a diverse set of simulation experiments was conducted using real-world GIS data and implementing different garbage collection scenarios driven by robot swarms. Results presented in this research show that the proposed system outperforms current approaches. Moreover, results not only show the efficiency of our solution, but also give insights about how to design and customize these systems."
937,"Use of electrical resistivity methods for detecting subsurface fresh and saline water and delineating their interfacial configuration: a case study of the eastern Dead Sea coastal aquifers, Jordan",A. Batayneh,Hydrogeology Journal,"The alluvial aquifer is the primary source of groundwater along the eastern Dead Sea shoreline, Jordan. Over the last 20 years, salinity has risen in some existing wells and several new wells have encountered brackish water in areas thought to contain fresh water. A good linear correlation exists between the water resistivity and the chloride concentration of groundwater and shows that the salinity is the most important factor controlling resistivity. Two-dimensional electrical tomography (ET) integrated with geoelectrical soundings were employed to delineate different water-bearing formations and the configuration of the interface between them. The present hydrological system and the related brines and interfaces are controlled by the Dead Sea base level, presently at 410 m b.s.l. Resistivity measurements show a dominant trend of decreasing resistivity (thus increasing salinity) with depth and westward towards the Dead Sea. Accordingly, three zones with different resistivity values were detected, corresponding to three different water-bearing formations: (1) strata saturated with fresh to slightly brackish groundwater; (2) a transition zone of brine mixed with fresh to brackish groundwater; (3) a water-bearing formation containing Dead Sea brine. In addition, a low resistivity unit containing brine was detected above the 1955 Dead Sea base level, which was interpreted as having remained unflushed by infiltrating rain. L’aquifère alluvial est la première ressource en eau souterraine le long de la Cote Est de la Mer Morte, Jordanie. Sur les 20 dernières années, la salinité a augmenté dans certains puits existants tandis que les eaux saumâtres sont apparues dans des puits récemment construits. Une bonne relation linéaire existe entre la résistivité de l’eau et la concentration en chlorures des eaux souterraines et montre dés lors que la salinité est le facteur dominant de la résistivité. Une tomographie électrique (ET) à deux dimensions intégrée avec des sondages géoélectriques a été employée pour délimiter les différentes masses d’eau et l’interface qui les sépare. Le système hydrogéologique actuel, les saumures et l’interface eau douce – saumures, sont contrôlées par le niveau de la Mer Morte, 410 m sous le niveau moyen des mers. Les mesures montrent une augmentation de la salinité avec la profondeur et vers la Mer Morte. Trois zones de différentes résistivités ont été détectées, correspondant à trois formations aquifères distinctes : (1) les strates saturées par de l’eau douce à légèrement saumâtre ; (2) une zone de transition entre les saumures mélangées avec les eaux souterraines douces à saumâtres (3) les saumures de la Mer Morte rentrées dans un aquifère. De plus, une unité de faible résistivité contenant des saumures à été détectée sous le niveau de 1955 de la Mer Morte, décrite auparavant comme ayant été resté lessivé par les eaux de pluie infiltrantes. El acuífero aluvial es la fuente principal de agua subterránea a lo largo de la línea de costa oriental del Mar Muerto, Jordania. Durante los últimos 20 años, la salinidad se ha incrementado en algunos pozos existentes y varios pozos nuevos han interceptado agua salina en áreas que se pensaba contenían agua fresca. Existe una correlación linear buena entre la resistividad del agua y la concentración de cloruro en agua subterránea lo cual muestra que la salinidad es el factor más importante que controla la resistividad. Se utilizó tomografía eléctrica bi-dimensional (ET) integrada con sondeos geoeléctricos para delimitar distintas formaciones portadoras de agua y la configuración del contacto entre ellas. El sistema hidrológico actual y las salmueras relacionadas están controlados por el nivel base del Mar Muerto, que se localiza actualmente a 410m por debajo del nivel del mar. Las mediciones de resistividad muestran una tendencia dominante de resistividad decreciente (es decir salinidad ascendente) con la profundidad y hacia el oeste en dirección del Mar Muerto. En consistencia con esta tendencia se detectaron tres zonas con diferentes valores de resistividad las cuales corresponden a tres formaciones acuíferas distintas: (1) estratos saturados con agua subterránea fresca a ligeramente salada; (2) una zona de transición de agua subterránea salada a fresca mezclada con salmueras; (3) formación acuífera conteniendo salmuera del Mar Muerto. Además se detectó una unidad de baja resistividad que contiene salmuera por encima del nivel de base que tenía el Mar Muerto en el año 1955, lo cual se interpretó como agua de lluvia infiltrada que permanecía sin lavarse."
938,Usefulness of terbium-sensitised luminescence detection for the chemometric classification of wines by their content in phenolic compounds,A. Andreu-Navarro;P. Russo;M. Aguilar-Caballos;J. Fernández-Romero;A. Gómez-Hens,Food Chemistry,"A method for wine classification based on the phenolic compound content, wine variety and geographical area is described. The method involves the use of the results obtained from the analysis of fifteen samples of Italian and Spanish wines from different geographical origins [Sicilia (Italy) and Córdoba (Spain)] using liquid chromatography (LC) with photometric and fluorimetric detection, in which eighteen phenolics were determined: gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, salicylic acid, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, catechin, vanillin, p-coumaric acid, syringaldehyde, epicatechin, ferulic acid, rutin, trans- and cis-resveratrol, quercetin and kaempferol. Photometric measurements were performed selecting four wavelengths (256, 280, 320 and 365 nm), using a diode-array detection system. The fluorimetric detection was achieved by measuring the sensitised luminescence provided by the chelates formed between each analyte and terbium (III). All samples were commercial wines bought in local markets and analysed immediately after they were opened. The pattern data matrix was constructed by the concentration of each analyte present in wine, which was determined by the most adequate method, namely LC-photometric or LC-fluorimetric method. This data matrix was subjected to different algorithms in order to classify and characterise the wine samples adequately. Supervised (LDA) and un-supervised (FA) pattern recognition methods were used. The wine pattern generation with LC separation and dual detection approach to determine eighteen phenolic compounds and the chemometric treatment provide an appropriate way with recognition and prediction rates. The values obtained for these rates were 100% when fluorimetric detection was used. These results can be considered satisfactory, which proves the usefulness of the selected variables."
939,Using Deliberative and Qualitative Methods to Mobilize Community Around the Mental Health Needs of Rural African Americans,A. Cheney;T. Haynes;M. Olson;N. Cottoms;K. Bryant;C. Reaves;M. Reich;G. Curran;G. Sullivan,Health Systems & Reform,"Abstract—Deliberative methods obtain informed and well-reasoned public input on health topics but are rarely accompanied by rigorous qualitative methods that can ground findings in community members’ shared experiences. In this project, we used Deliberative Democracy Forums, a deliberative process, to bring diverse community members together to collectively discuss mental health among rural African Americans, brainstorm solutions to address mental health needs, deliberate alternate solutions, and indicate steps for future action. By using rigorous qualitative methods to document the deliberative process and analyze deliberative dialogue, we produced a strong evidence base to inform future health care policy and research. In this article, we document our approach, present forum findings, and discuss the impact of deliberation on policy and research. We conclude that the combination of deliberative process and qualitative methods used in our project can produce a deeply contextualized understanding of mental health and identify community-initiated solutions to address mental health needs in resource-poor communities, which can help guide public health research and provide an evidence base for public health policy."

Huse;G. Vankó;C. Bressler;J. Mccusker,Inorganic Chemistry,"We have employed a range of ultrafast X-ray spectroscopies in an effort to characterize the lowest energy excited state of [Fe(dcpp)2]2+ (where dcpp is 2,6-(dicarboxypyridyl)pyridine). This compound exhibits an unusually short excited-state lifetime for a low-spin Fe(II) polypyridyl complex of 270 ps in a room-temperature fluid solution, raising questions as to whether the ligand-field strength of dcpp had pushed this system beyond the 5T2/3T1 crossing point and stabilizing the latter as the lowest energy excited state. Kα and Kβ X-ray emission spectroscopies have been used to unambiguously determine the quintet spin multiplicity of the long-lived excited state, thereby establishing the 5T2 state as the lowest energy excited state of this compound. Geometric changes associated with the photoinduced ligand-field state conversion have also been monitored with extended X-ray absorption fine structure. The data show the typical average Fe-ligand bond length elongation of ∼0.18 Å for a 5T2 state and suggest a high anisotropy of the primary coordination sphere around the metal center in the excited 5T2 state, in stark contrast to the nearly perfect octahedral symmetry that characterizes the low-spin 1A1 ground state structure. This study illustrates how the application of time-resolved X-ray techniques can provide insights into the electronic structures of molecules—in particular, transition metal complexes—that are difficult if not impossible to obtain by other means."
941,Using multi variate data mining techniques for estimating fire susceptibility of Tyrolean forests,A. Arpaci;B. Malowerschnig;O. Sass;H. Vacik,Applied Geography,"Forest fires in the Alps might become more hazardous in the future due to their linkage to high temperatures and drought periods. To understand the driving forces and the actual distribution patterns of forest fires is crucial to adapt to those future challenges. We used the province Tyrol in Austria as a case study area. We tested two machine learning algorithms (MaxEnt and RandomForests) for their capability in use with historic fire data and environmental datasets. Presence-only data of 399 forest fires between 1993 and 2011 was compared with a range of topography, vegetation, climate and socio-economic datasets, in order to find out the main driving parameters of the spatial forest fire distribution and to delimit areas of particular fire danger. The results of both algorithms were compared for agreement and differences.Both algorithms delivered broadly similar results; climate (number of days above a certain fire weather index) and anthropogenic parameters (distance to buildings, population density) are the most important parameters in the current alpine fire regime. The models slightly disagreed on the role of forest type and of topography. Joined model results show a strong concentration of potential fire danger along the main valleys and in the drier Tyrolean Upland.We did compare Randomforest and MaxEnt.Analyzing occurrence patterns of 399 wildfire in the Tyrolean Alps, Austria.Results were maps of fire susceptibility.Both techniques agreed that human settlements and climate patterns are the most important drivers of wildfires in the study area.Forest fires in the Alps might become more hazardous in the future due to their linkage to high temperatures and drought periods.

942,Using the Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit to Improve the Quality of Patient Materials,A. Brega;M. Freedman;W. Leblanc;J. Barnard;N. Mabachi;M. Cifuentes;K. Albright;B. Weiss;C. Brach;D. West,Journal of Health Communication,"Patient materials are often written above the reading level of most adults. Tool 11 of the Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit (“Design Easy-to-Read Material”) provides guidance on ensuring that written patient materials are easy to understand. As part of a pragmatic demonstration of the Toolkit, we examined how four primary care practices implemented Tool 11 and whether written materials improved as a result. We conducted interviews to learn about practices' implementation activities and assessed the readability, understandability, and actionability of patient education materials collected during pre- and postimplementation site visits. Interview data indicated that practices followed many action steps recommended in Tool 11, including training staff, assessing readability, and developing or revising materials, typically focusing on brief documents such as patient letters and information sheets. Many of the revised and newly developed documents had reading levels appropriate for most patients and—in the case of revised documents—better readability than the original materials. In contrast, the readability, understandability, and actionability of lengthier patient education materials were poor and did not improve over the 6-month implementation period. Findings guided revisions to Tool 11 and highlighted the importance of engaging multiple stakeholders in improving the quality of patient materials."
943,Utility of organic carbon isotope data from the Salina Group halite (Michigan Basin): A new tool for stratigraphic correlation and paleoclimate proxy resource,A. Caruthers;D. Gröcke;S. Kaczmarek;M. Rine;J. Kuglitsch;W. Harrison,GSA Bulletin,"Long-term global carbon isotope records (δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg) for the Silurian have been largely derived from unrestricted open-marine carbonates and shales. Here, we demonstrate how organic carbon harvested from halite-dominated evaporite deposits in a restricted intracratonic basin can be used to produce a carbon isotope record. Inorganic and organic carbon isotope data were generated and compared from four subsurface cores from the Silurian Michigan Basin, representing unrestricted carbonate and restricted evaporite/carbonate deposition. The δ13Ccarb and δ13Corg records exhibit a number of long-term trends and major carbon isotope excursions (CIE) that are correlated with the globally identified Ireviken, Mulde, and Linde events. These data provide temporal and stratigraphic constraints in rocks where paleontological data are sparse or absent. They also potentially highlight the effect of enhanced local evaporation on isotope fractionation. This new technique for generating a long-term organic carbon isotope profile from Silurian halite sequences, which can be correlated to the global curve, is of broad interest to the geoscience and paleoclimate science communities. These data not only provide a valuable tool for understanding the chronostratigraphic framework within an evaporative interior basin, but they also provide a rare temporal link between periods of prolonged evaporite deposition and events of known paleoclimate change."
944,"V.—Contributions to Ceylon Geology: Occurrence of Corundum In Sitû Near Kandy, Ceylon",A. Coomáraswámy,Geological Magazine,"The present notes are based on field observations made in 1900. The section described is now obscured.Corundum is abundant in the gem-bearing gravels of Ceylon, but with the exception of the case here described no localities are known where it occurs in sitû; the present occurrence is therefore of considerable interest, although not very satisfactory in itself.Crystals of corundum were found in the surface soil on a piece of land known as Tenna Hena, and situated east of Kandy, and three-quarters of a mile north-east of Talatnoya bridge. The exact spot is shown in a map accompanying a paper on the crystalline limestones of Ceylon (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc, 1903, vol. lviii, pl. xiii). A small excavation had been made, and a few pounds of corundum extracted and sold for use as emery, before my visit to the spot. All the rock exposed was decomposed, and crumbled in the fingers, being in a condition resembling sand. I therefore carried on an excavation for two months, hoping to reach hard rock suitable for microscopic examination, but although a depth of about 30 feet was reached, no sufficiently hard rock was found.At the corundum pit the ‘beds’ of granulite dip northwards at a high angle. A conspicuous soft yellow micaceous band 7–3 inches wide marks the position of the sapphire-bearing zone. The sapphires occur in fair abundance in a less decomposed felspathic rock occupying a few inches on either side of this yellow micaceous band in the upper part of the shaft, but on the south side only in the lower part. The associated types of granulite are chiefly acid leptynite."
945,"V.—Contributions to the Geology of Ceylon: 4. Intrusive Pyroxenites, Mica-Pyroxenites, and Mica-Rocks in the Charnookite Series or Granulites in Ceylon",A. Coomáraswámy,Geological Magazine,"The object of the present paper is to provide a short account of a group of rocks to which the general name of pyroxenite may be given, inasmuch as they are essentially non-felspathic plutonic rocks, free from olivine, and of igneous origin, and with a nearly colourless monoclinic pyroxene as the chief or only constituent of many of the most conspicuous varieties. The exposures are widely distributed in the Central, Ova, and Sabaragamuwa provinces, and probably throughout Ceylon, but are individually of very small extent. The rocks are composed of the minerals diopside, amphibole, phlogopite (or biotite), scapolite, pyrite, sphene, and sometimes felspar, calcite, and spinel; the dominant mineral is the pale green or grey granular diopside, colourless in thin sections: the rocks are often entirely, or almost entirely, composed of this mineral; next in importance are green amphibole (dark in hand-specimens, but very pale in thin sections), and a pale golden-brown phlogopite, which sometimes forms a large proportion of the rock, and in extreme cases the whole bulk of sills or dykes several feet in thickness."
946,V.—Occurrence of Radiolaria in Gondwána Beds near Madras,A. Coomáraswámy,Geological Magazine,"The Upper Gondwána (Rajmahál Series) beds near Madras are divided into two groups, the lower of which has been named from Sripermatúr, a town 25 miles west-south-west of Madras, and a well-known locality for fossil plants. The group is composed of white and pale buff-coloured shales containing plants, at least 10 feet in thickness, resting upon sandstones, grits, and micaceous sandy shales, at least 15 feet in thickness, whose base is not seen, but which probably rest on the gneiss. Silicified wood occurs in some of the gritty beds. The other fossils occur in the shales, and consist of plant and animal remains. The latter are poor, and comprise two or three indeterminable species of ammonites and several lamellibranch bivalves."
947,VII.—Contributions to the Geology of Ceylon: III. The Balangoda Group,A. Coomáraswámy,Geological Magazine,"The name ‘Balangoda group’ is proposed for a series of granitic and pegmatite-like rocks, intrusive in, but distinct from, the Charnockite series; first met with in the Balangoda district, but evidently widely distributed over a large area between Balangoda and Hatton. The rocks are best described as granites, but occur most often in rather narrow dykes, after the manner of pegmatites. Yet there is no reason for separating the smaller from the larger masses, and the term granite is applied to both. The group (of which a more detailed account will ultimately be needed) includes in particular zircon granite, allanite granite, magnetite granite, and granite without conspicuous accessory minerals; as well as the probably similar rocks in which the hitherto unlocated minerals geikielite, baddeleyite, rutile, fergusonite, thorite, thorianite, etc., may be looked for; and the vein of pegmatite at Gampola, which consisted of quartz, felspars, and biotite, with apatite, ilmenite, tourmaline, and the new mineral described as thorianite as accessory minerals.These granites are intrusive in the Charnockite series, and though frequently occurring in lenticular masses (Denagama) with a disposition parallel to that of the foliation planes of the charnockites, have often been observed to transgress these foliation planes and to behave as intrusive rocks. Contact phenomena have not, however, been observed, except perhaps in a slight tendency to a peripheral fineness of grain in the intrusive rocks. At the junctions granite and charnockite are usually welded together, there being no absolutely hard line of separation, although the junction may be called sharp; in the case of the larger masses no good junctions have been seen."
948,VII.—Origin of the Crystalline Limestones of Ceylon,A. Coomáraswámy,Geological Magazine,"It is generally supposed that the crystalline limestones which occur amongst the schists, associated with orthogneisses, in various parts of the world, are altered sedimentary limestones whose accessory minerals and crystalline structure have been developed by simple contact and dynamo-metamorphism; and no doubt many crystalline limestones are of sedimentary origin, and owe their peculiarities to these agencies. In other cases the peculiar mode of occurrence of such rocks or their manner of association with igneous rocks (orthogneisses or nepheline-syenites) has led to the suggestion of other theories."

Spallucci,Nuclear Physics B,"The “vacuum pressure” mechanism of the hadronic bag model is taken as a guide to formulate the dynamics of closed domain walls in the cosmological case. The effective action functional suggested by this analogy is a straightforward generalization of the Einstein-Maxwell action: it involves a 3-index antisymmetric potential whose coupling to matter generates two effective cosmological constants, one inside and one outside the domain wall. It is suggested that this mechanism, which is alternative to the introduction of a Higgs potential, is the source of the bubble nucleation process envisaged in the new inflationary cosmology. The dynamics of a spherical domain in a de Sitter phase is analyzed and is consistent with the geometrical formulation of shell dynamics proposed long ago by Israel.The “vacuum pressure” mechanism of the hadronic bag model is taken as a guide to formulate the dynamics of closed domain walls in the cosmological case.

950,Valuation of expectations: A hedonic study of shale gas development and New York’s moratorium,A. Boslett;T. Guilfoos;C. Lang,Journal of Environmental Economics and Management,"This paper examines the local impacts of shale gas development (SGD). We use a hedonic framework and exploit a discrete change in expectations about SGD caused by the New York State moratorium on hydraulic fracturing. Our research design combines difference-in-differences and border discontinuity, as well as underlying shale geology, on properties in Pennsylvania and New York. Results suggest that New York properties that were most likely to experience both the financial benefits and environmental consequences of SGD dropped in value 23% as a result of the moratorium, which under certain assumptions indicates a large and positive net valuation of SGD."
951,Valuation of the External Costs of Unconventional Oil and Gas Development: The Critical Importance of Mineral Rights Ownership,A. Boslett;T. Guilfoos;C. Lang,Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists,"We quantify the externalities associated with unconventional oil and gas development using hedonic valuation. One complication in determining local impacts is that some but not all properties are unified with mineral rights, which enable the residents to financially benefit from drilling, and this information is typically unobserved by researchers. To overcome this issue, we exploit the mineral severance legacy of the homestead act extensions of the twentieth century to identify properties in western Colorado that do not have mineral rights and are therefore only impacted negatively by drilling. We find housing prices decline about 35% when drilling occurs within 1 mile. Treated properties are affected by highly intensive drilling (∼16 wells drilled within a mile, on average), and there is suggestive evidence of nonlinear impacts on a per-well basis. Our estimate of local costs is larger than those found elsewhere in the literature, which demonstrates the critical importance of mineral ownership."
952,Value and risk assessment of supply chain management improvement projects,A. Brun;M. Caridi;K. Salama;I. Ravelli,International Journal of Production Economics,"In this paper the decisional process of the introduction of a new information system for advanced planning and scheduling and supply chain management (APS/SCM) is discussed, with particular care given to the value assessment stage. In a research programme recently carried out at Politecnico di Milano a new methodology has been developed and tested on a set of test bed cases. The methodology is based on the consideration that activities whose execution can be supported by APS/SCM solutions may have an impact on the key performances of a supply chain. In particular, in the first phase of the value assessment methodology the identification of the information requirements is carried out, thus allowing an estimate of the punctual value generated by the information system solution. The following phase provides a risk analysis of the estimated value. As information systems’ implementations have impacts not only on economic value but also on strategic and intangible issues, this needs a deep review of traditional risk analysis approaches. After introducing the issue of value assessment of APS/SCM information systems, a summary of the value assessment methodology developed at Politecnico di Milano will be given. Finally a case study is provided to give more insights on the practical application of the methodology."

They allow new forms of communication between buyers and sellers and they are expected to provide opportunities to create new marketplaces, whilst firm's productivity and efficiency should benefit. Because of the recent history of such type of projects, it hasn’t been possible yet to identify neither clear guidelines for the implementation process nor evaluation procedures for assessing the validity of a certain e-Business project. Furthermore, it has to be noted that a high number of e-Projects have failed or haven’t led to the expected results. This paper focuses on a particular aspect of this new way of doing business: the transfer of a part of purchasing activities on the net, the so called e-Procurement. The proposed methodology aims to give a structured procedure for both a quantitative and a qualitative evaluation of a certain e-Procurement investment starting from the identification of the main relationships among relevant elements influenced by the e-Procurement introduction (activities, performance indicators and company's features). The analysis also includes some considerations of a strategic nature and should lead to the reduction of a final report which has to support managers during the investment decision by highlighting expected benefits. The application of the proposed methodology to an Italian firm which has introduced the e-Procurement is described."
954,Variable Neighborhood Search with Cost Function Networks To Solve Large Computational Protein Design Problems,A. Charpentier;D. Mignon;S. Barbe;J. Cortes;T. Schiex;T. Simonson;D. Allouche,Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling,"Computational protein design (CPD) aims to predict amino acid sequences that fold to specific structures and perform desired functions. CPD depends on a rotamer library, an energy function, and an algorithm to search the sequence/conformation space. Variable neighborhood search (VNS) with cost function networks is a powerful framework that can provide tight upper bounds on the global minimum energy. We propose a new CPD heuristic based on VNS in which a subset of the solution space (a “neighborhood”) is explored, whose size is gradually increased with a dedicated probabilistic heuristic. The algorithm was tested on 99 protein designs with fixed backbones involving nine proteins from the SH2, SH3, and PDZ families. The number of mutating positions was 20, 30, or all of the amino acids, while the rest of the protein explored side-chain rotamers. VNS was more successful than Monte Carlo (MC), replica-exchange MC, and a heuristic steepest-descent energy minimization, providing solutions with equal or lower best energies in most cases. For complete protein redesign, it gave solutions that were 2.5 to 11.2 kcal/mol lower in energy than those obtained with the other approaches. VNS is implemented in the toulbar2 software. It could be very helpful for large and/or complex design problems."
955,Variable offspring size as an adaptation to environmental heterogeneity in a clonal plant species: integrating experimental and modelling approaches,A. Charpentier;M. Anand;C. Bauch,Journal of Ecology,"Summary 1. The production of variably sized offspring has been hypothesized to be adaptive to temporal variability in environmental conditions. 2. This is difficult to verify empirically, and theoretical models are typically generic and not parameterized with data from real populations; studies integrating theoretical and empirical approaches to this problem are rare. 3. Here, we present experimental data on the growth of Scirpus maritimus, a clonal aquatic macrophyte that grows through vegetative extensions involving tubers. 4. The experiments show that offspring fitness (biomass productivity) is dependent on environmental conditions (water depth). 5. Experimental data indicate that variation in offspring (tuber) sizes can be approximated by a lognormal distribution. 6. We use these data to develop a different equation model of S. maritimus growth to test whether producing variably sized offspring is adaptive. The model compares fitness under the lognormal strategy to several hypothetical strategies with qualitatively different variance in offspring size. 7. The model results suggest that lognormal variation in S. maritimus tuber size may be adaptive to the temporal variation in water levels that characterize its natural Mediterranean environment. 8. We illustrate how the underlying principles that lend adaptive value to offspring size variation may apply to other species experiencing similar environmental conditions. 9. Synthesis. Close integration of data and theoretical models creates a unique tool for investigating the adaptive value of life‐history traits in clonal aquatic plants."

Injectors were analyzed before and after IOL insertion. Surgery was performed on rabbits with 71 IOL injectors of 13 models, and custom gauges were used to determine the incision size before and after surgery.The injector dimensions varied by model; tip diameter, tip angle, and cone angle ranged from 1.44 to 2.12 mm, 29.7 to 66.5 degrees and 0.6 to 10.8 degrees, respectively. The incision size through which surgery was successfully performed also varied by injector model; the initial incision sizes ranged from 2.0 to 2.63 mm. For all injectors, there was wound enlargement after IOL insertion that ranged from a 0.1 to 0.65 mm increase in incision length.The dimensions and injection systems varied with each IOL injector. All injectors led to postoperative wound stretch after IOL insertion, with no final incision measuring less than 2.0 mm. These findings suggest that the clear cornea incision should have a width corresponding to the injector diameter."
957,Vascular Burden of the White Matter,A. Brun,International Psychogeriatrics,"In cerebrovascular disease of all kinds, the white matter bears a heavy burden – particularly in the early and late periods of life. The infarcts are of the complete and incomplete type, the latter accompanying and extending the white-matter damage of the former. Complete infarcts are mainly caused by vascular occlusions. Incomplete infarcts are mainly due to hypoperfusion, wherein pathogenic factors are, above all, different types of angiopathies leading to an inadequate autoregulatory response in the event of an episodic or more longstanding hypotension, acting as an etiological factor through hypoperfusion. There is growing consensus that white-matter lesions affect brain function. Correlation with symptoms and understanding of mechanisms behind the lesions would gain from more precise diagnostics as to tracts involved."

Sisay,Journal of Arid Environments,"In the dry woodlands of Africa, stem cuttings of some tree species can root easily for successful vegetative propagation. Successful rooting and establishment of planted cuttings can be affected by size of cutting, planting season, age of parent stock and part of plant used. Propagule length and four collection times were studied on their effect on the survival of branch cuttings of Boswellia papyrifera over a six-year period. The study was carried in a semi-arid area of northwest Ethiopia, where the rainfall occurs from June to September and the other part of the year being too dry to normal plant physiological functioning. Collection time, cutting length and their interaction showed significant differences in mean survival rate. The higher mean survival value was observed from those cutting materials collected in May. The weakest performance was observed from those cutting materials collected in October. The observed difference may be effect of phenological calendar of the species, especially the effect of dormancy period and leaf bud breaking times. Longer stem cuttings did not show persistent better performance across time.

Ferain,Advanced Functional Materials,"A novel and general methodology for preparing vertical, complex‐oxide nanostructures from a sol–gel‐based polymer‐precursor solutions is developed using track‐etched polymers directly buffering substrates. This method is able to develop a nanostructure over the entire substrate, the dimensions and localization of the vertical nanostructures being preset by the polymeric nanotemplate. Thereby, nanostructures with lateral sizes in the range of 100 to 300 nm and up to 500 nm in height have been grown. Two examples are presented herein, the latter being the evolution of the initial, metastable nanostructure. Specifically, La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 polycrystalline rods are grown at mild temperatures (800 °C); upon strong thermal activation (1000 °C) they suffer a profound transformation into vertical, single‐crystalline (La,Sr)xOy nanopyramids sitting on a La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 epitaxial wetting layer. The driving force for this outstanding nanostructural evolution is the minimization of the total energy of the system, which is reached by reducing the grain‐boundary, total‐surface, and strain‐relaxation energies. Finally, advanced electron‐microscopy techniques are used to highlight the complex phase separation and structural transformations occurring when the metastable state is overcome."

961,Vertical Spreading of Aqueous Trisiloxane Solution Driven by a Spontaneously Developing Surface Tension Gradient,A. Chengara;A. Nikolov;D. Wasan,Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research,"This article reports the results of experiments conducted on the spontaneous climbing of an aqueous film of trisiloxane surfactants (“superspreaders”) on a vertical strongly hydrophobic solid surface. The final height achieved is much in excess of that expected purely on the basis of the capillary wetting action and suggests that a spontaneously developing surface tension gradient aids in film climbing. Maxima are observed in both the spreading rate and the height achieved as a function of the surfactant concentration, similar to the spreading of a superspreader drop on a horizontal hydrophobic surface."
962,Vertical separation vs. independent downstream entry in an electricity network: Experimental insights,A. Ciarreta;E. Fatas;N. Georgantzís;C. Gutiérrez-Hita,Electric Power Systems Research,"We analyze a realistic simulation of a complex electricity network. We obtain the data with a series of experimental sessions designed to closely replicate the Spanish electricity market. In the experiments reported here we compare the status quo with two alternative regulatory market structures. In one of them, labeled as vertical separation, we impose that power generating firms and electricity distributors operate as independent business groups. In the second, we study the effect of entry by independent end-suppliers. Both alternative scenarios dominate the status quo in terms of market efficiency, but the latter of them dominates the former."
963,Vertical vibration of rigid bodies with rectangular bases on elastic media,A. Awojobi;P. Tabiowo,Earthquake Engineering and Structural Dynamics,"Dual double integral equations completely representing the mixed boundary‐value problem of the vertical vibration of rigid bodies with rectangular bases on semi‐infinite elastic media are exactly formulated for the first time. An exact solution of these equations—even for the static case—is at present formidable, but an approximate solution is given by reducing the pair of dual double integral equations to another pair which shows an approximate relation between the three‐dimensional and axi‐symmetric systems. This new method is used to generate response curves for Poisson's ratio 0.25 and side ratios 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, from known results for circular bases, for the dynamic problem. Results obtained by using this technique are in good agreement with experiments in Reference 3 where expanded rubber is used as the elastic medium. The present theory which is applicable for any Poisson's ratio also shows some measure of agreement with the theory of Elorduy et al.4 which is limited, by its numerical nature, to a Poisson's ratio of 0.25."
964,"Vertical, radial and drag force analysis of superconducting magnetic bearings",A. Cansiz,Superconductor Science and Technology,"The behavior of the force between a permanent magnet (PM) and a high temperature superconductor (HTS) was tested with the frozen-image model based on flux pinning. It was found that the associated dipole moment assumptions of the method of the frozen image underestimate the force somewhat; thus a quadrupole moment analysis is proposed. The radial and drag forces associated with the rotation of the PM levitated above the HTS were measured by using a force transducer and by means of a cantilevered beam technique. The radial force was found not to be dependent on the radial direction, and the least radial force was found to be periodic with an angular displacement during the slow rotation of the PM relative to the HTS. The periodicity behavior of the force is attributed to the geometric eccentricity from the magnetization distribution of the PM and HTS. The drag force associated with the torsional stiffness of the levitated PM during the low and high rotational speeds was incorporated with the data from the literature."
965,Vested interests as driver of the clean energy transition: Evidence from Russia's solar energy policy,A. Boute;A. Zhikharev,Energy Policy,"By contrast to the common objective of decarbonization of electricity production, the main driver of Russia's renewable energy policy is to achieve the economic benefits related to the manufacturing of green equipment. The focus on industrial development rather than the decarbonization of the power sector clearly appears from the decision of the Russian government to tie renewable energy subsidies to stringent local content requirements. In particular, solar energy benefits from a subsidy regime that is favourable to local manufacturers. Based on a detailed analysis of Russian renewable energy regulation, this paper studies the benefits for solar generation and explains this favourable treatment based on the vested interests of influential industrial groups in the solar PV manufacturing sector. These vested interests helped to overcome the resistance to renewable energy in an economy heavily dependent on oil and gas. More fundamentally, the influence of the local solar energy industry enabled the development of a support scheme that eventually stimulated the deployment of renewable energy technologies in general."
966,Vibrational coherence of self-organized silver nanocrystals in f.c.c. supra-crystals,A. Courty;A. Mermet;P. Albouy;E. Duval;M. Pileni,Nature Materials,"Fabrication of devices from inorganic nanocrystals normally requires that they are self-organized into ordered structures. It has now been demonstrated that nanocrystals are able to self-organize in a 'supra'-crystal with a face-centred cubic (f.c.c.) structure1,2,3. The physical properties of nanocrystals self-organized into compact arrays are quite different from those of both isolated nanocrystals and the bulk phase. The collective optical1,4 and magnetic1,5 properties of these nanocrystal assemblies are governed mainly by dipolar interactions. Here, we show that nanocrystals vibrate coherently when they are self-organized in f.c.c. supra-crystals. Hence, a phase relation exists between the vibrations of all of the nanocrystals in a supra-crystal. This vibrational coherence can be observed by a substantial change of the quadrupolar low-frequency Raman scattering peak. Although a change in electronic transport properties has previously been observed on self-organization of silver nanocrystals6, vibrational coherence represents the first intrinsic property of f.c.c. supra-crystals.Fabrication of devices from inorganic nanocrystals normally requires that they are self-organized into ordered structures.

Farcomeni;D. Negri;A. Cafaro;B. Ensoli;F. Titti,Archives of Virology,"Simian–human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) 89.6P is considered to be one of the most pathogenic chimeric viruses in rhesus macaques. However, when crossing from one to another species of monkeys the pathogenicity of this virus may be affected. By using SHIV-89.6Pcy243, a virus obtained by passaging SHIV-89.6P in cynomolgus macaques, we investigated the dynamics of viral replication and the impact of the inoculum size (from 10 up to 50 monkey infectious dose) on the progression of the infection in 22 cynomolgus macaques. SHIV-89.6Pcy243 caused massive depletion of CD4+ T-cells within 4 weeks of the inoculum, followed by an irreversible immune deficiency in a high proportion of the infected monkeys. This study demonstrates that SHIV-89.6Pcy243 is pathogenic in cynomolgus macaques and that the dynamics of the viral replication and the rate of clinical progression depend on the size of the inoculum. Our findings provide unique and relevant data, particularly with regard to the value of the in vivo titration used to select the most appropriate infectious dose to study the “virus-host” interplay."
968,Vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women impairs regulatory T cell function,A. Chary;R. Hemalatha;M. Seshacharyulu;M. Murali;B. Kumar,Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,"Regulatory T cells and IgE receptors (CD23 and CD21) on B cells were assessed in vitamin D deficient pregnant women. For this, 153 pregnant women were recruited from a government hospital and were categorized into three groups based on 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) status. Regulatory T cell population (Treg cells) and CD23/CD21 expression on B cells were quantified by FACS ARIA II in maternal blood at third trimester; and the same parameters were evaluated in cord blood soon after delivery. In addition, TGF β and IL-10 were quantified in maternal and cord blood by using Milliplex kits. In a representative sample of eight women from each group (vitamin D sufficient, insufficient and deficient), placental tissues were processed for mRNA expressions of vitamin D receptor (VDR), retinoic acid receptor (RXR), vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) and vitamin D regulating enzymes. Of the 153 pregnant women, 18 were sufficient (≥30 ng/mL), 55 were insufficient (20–29 ng/mL) and 80 were deficient (≤19 ng/mL) for 25(OH)D3 status. The maternal blood Treg cell population (mean (%) ± SE) was lower (p &lt; 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 deficient (0.2 ± 0.01) pregnant women compared to insufficient (0.34 ± 0.01) and sufficient (0.45 ± 0.02) pregnant women. Similarly, cord blood Treg cell population (mean (%) ± SE) was also lower (p &lt; 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 deficient (0.63 ± 0.03) pregnant women when compared to insufficient (1.05 ± 0.04) and sufficient (1.75 ± 0.02) pregnant women. Mean (%) ± SE of B cells with CD23 and CD21 in maternal blood was higher (p &lt; 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 deficient pregnant women (0.35 ± 0.02; 1.65 ± 0.04) when compared to insufficient (0.22 ± 0.02; 0.55 ± 0.05) and sufficient (0.15 ± 0.02; 0.21 ± 0.01) pregnant women. Similarly, mean (%) ± SE of B cell population with CD23 and CD21 in cord blood was also higher (p &lt; 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 deficient (0.41 ± 0.02; 1.2 ± 0.03) when compared to insufficient (0.32 ± 0.01; 0.6 ± 0.05) and sufficient (0.2 ± 0.01; 0.4 ± 0.02) pregnant women.Regulatory cytokines, TGF β and IL-10 were lower (p &lt; 0.05) in 25(OH)D3 insufficient and deficient subjects. In the placenta tissue of women with 25(OH)D3 deficiency, the regulatory T cell transcription factor FOXP3, vitamin D receptor (VDR) and retinoic acid receptor (RXR) expressions were downregulated. In contrast, CD23, CD21 and VDBP expressions were upregulated in 25(OH)D3 deficient and insufficient women. Vitamin D regulating enzymes (CYP24A1, CYP2R1 and CYP27B1) expression were also altered in women with 25(OH)D3 deficiency. The current study shows that impaired maternal 25(OH)D3 during pregnancy influences the spectrum of immune cells such as regulatory T cells and B cells with IgE receptors and this in turn may be linked to allergy and asthma in neonates."

Iqelan,Medical Physics,"Purpose: To determine the variation in pediatiric and adult doses in cardiac catheterization and angiography procedures and investigate factors that correlate with radiation. Methods and Materials: Effective doses were estimated from the dose area product values of 761 pediatric patients belonging to age groups 0, 1, 5 and 10 years old who underwent coarctation (COA) dilatation, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occlusion, pulmonary and diagnostic. The causes for high patient doses were investigated and the correlation of effective dose and DAP with patient weight, equivalent cylindrical diameter, fluoroscopy time and number of cine frames were analyzed. The maximum entance skin doses and effective doses were determined for 114 adult patients for cardiac catheterization and 320 adults for angiography procedures. Techniques to reduce patient entrance doses were investigated. Resuts: Pulmonary and PDA are high dose procedures with an average effective dose of 10 and 8.2 mSv respectively. DAP values showed a good correlation with effective doses for diagnostic and COA dilatation with r2 (p <0.0001) equal to 0.81 and 0.70 respectively. PTCA procedure delivered a maximum skin dose (4.5 mGy) that exceeded the threshold dose for skin erythemia. Percutaneous Transhepatic Choleangiography (PTC) and Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunts (TIPSS) delivered the maximum skin dose of 983 and 735 mGy. Conclusions: Review of the protocols and setting of image quality criteria for pediatric especially for age groups 0 and 1 and for adult patients in order that flurocospy time, peak kilovoltage and number of cine series be reduced is needed. Pooling all ages, an effective dose conversion coefficient of 120 cGy‐cm2 per mSv can be used for pediatric procedures. This research was supported by IAEA."

971,Waring's problem for polynomials in two variables,A. Bodin;M. Car,Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society,"We prove that all polynomials in several variables can be decomposed as the sums of $ k$ th powers: $ P(x_1,\ldots ,x_n) = Q_1(x_1,\ldots ,x_n)^k+\cdots + Q_s(x_1,\ldots ,x_n)^k$ , provided that elements of the base field are themselves sums of $ k$ th powers. We also give bounds for the number of terms $ s$ and the degree of the $ Q_i^k$ . We then improve these bounds in the case of two-variable polynomials of large degree to get a decomposition $ P(x,y) = Q_1(x,y)^k+\cdots + Q_s(x,y)^k$ with $ \deg Q_i^k \le \deg P + k^3$ and $ s$ that depends on $ k$ and $ \ln (\deg P)$ ."
972,Water Wars by Other Means: Virtual Water and Global Economic Restructuring,A. Biro,Global Environmental Politics,"In the mid-1990s, Tony Allan coined the term “virtual water” to describe international grain shipments, arguing that for purposes of economic efficiency and political legitimacy, governments in water-scarce nations would be better served by importing grain and diverting limited domestic water supplies to higher-value purposes than by producing grain. This concept has gained considerable traction in explaining the absence of “water wars,” particularly in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). As a prescriptive policy measure, I argue first that the exemplarity of the MENA serves an ideological function, premised on a market environmentalist approach, and framing “water crisis” as a problem of physical scarcity rather than underdevelopment. Historical trends in virtual water imports, as well as the problem of American primacy in virtual water exports, are then used to develop an account of virtual water trade that situates it within the political and economic restructuring associated with US-led globalization."
973,Weathering of meteorites from Oman: Correlation of chemical and mineralogical weathering proxies with 14C terrestrial ages and the influence of soil chemistry,A. Al‐Kathiri;B. Hofmann;A. Jull;E. Gnos,Meteoritics & Planetary Science,"— Fifty‐four fragments of ordinary chondrites from 50 finds representing all searched areas in central Oman and all weathering stages were selected to compare the physical, chemical, and mineralogical effect of terrestrial weathering with 14C terrestrial ages. 14C ages range from 2.0 to >49 kyr with a median value of 17.9 kyr. The peak of the age range, which is between 10–20 kyr, falls in an arid climate period. A comparison of the chemical composition of Omani chondrites with literature data for unweathered H and L chondrites demonstrates a strong enrichment in Sr and Ba, and depletion in S during weathering. Water contents in H chondrites increase with terrestrial age, whereas L chondrites show a rapid initial increase followed by nearly constant water content. Correlating Sr, Ba, and H2O with age indicates two absorption trends: i) an initial alteration within the first 20 kyr dominated by H2O uptake, mainly reflecting Fe‐Ni metal alteration, and ii) a second Ba‐and Sr‐dominated stage correlated with slower and less systematic weathering of troilite that starts after H2O reaches −2 wt%. Sulfur released from troilite partly combines with Ba and Sr to form sulfate minerals. Other parameters correlated with 14C age are degree of weathering, color of powdered meteorites, and the Ni/Fe ratio. Chemical analyses of 145 soils show a high degree of homogeneity over the entire interior Oman Desert, indicating large‐scale mixing by wind. Soil samples collected from beneath meteorite finds typically are enriched in Ni and Co, confirming mobilization from the meteorites. High Cr and Ni concentrations in reference soil samples, which decrease from NE to SW, are due to detrital material from ultramafic rocks of the Oman Mountains."
974,What Competencies Do Today's Academic Authors Need?,A. Baverstock,Journal of Scholarly Publishing,"The traditional model of academic author–publisher relations was one-way and service led, publisher to author. Today the possibilities for content development are vastly greater, underpinned by the two main drivers of change: new technologies and globalization. But within this new order the author, as creator of content, assumes a greater significance, and disintermediation raises the possibility of managing without a publisher altogether. The author of this essay, a former academic/educational publisher now running an MA in Publishing program at Kingston University London, assesses the new competencies that academic authors need and the marketing opportunities and relationships they can harness to promote their work, and encourages them to both be proactive and make the most of the connections with their publisher and their university—to the benefit of all involved."

Baroni,ArXiv Computer Science,"Although much effort has recently been devoted to training high-quality sentence embeddings, we still have a poor understanding of what they are capturing. ""Downstream"" tasks, often based on sentence classification, are commonly used to evaluate the quality of sentence representations. The complexity of the tasks makes it however difficult to infer what kind of information is present in the representations. We introduce here 10 probing tasks designed to capture simple linguistic features of sentences, and we use them to study embeddings generated by three different encoders trained in eight distinct ways, uncovering intriguing properties of both encoders and training methods."
976,When Supply Meets Demand: The Case of Hourly Spot Electricity Prices,A. Boogert;D. Dupont,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,We use a supply-demand framework to model the hourly day-ahead price of electricity (the spot price) based on publicly available information. With the model we can forecast the level and probability of a spike in the spot price defined as the spot price above a certain threshold. Several European countries have recently started publishing day-ahead forecasts of the available supply. This paper shows this forecasted capacity is quite successful in predicting spot price movements 24 h ahead.
977,When avoiding failure improves performance: Stereotype threat and the impact of performance goals,A. Chalabaev;B. Major;P. Sarrazin;F. Cury,Motivation and Emotion,"We examined the impact of inducing performance-avoidance and approach goals (versus no goal) on women’s math performance in stereotype threatening versus nonthreatening situations. Two experiments showed that inducing either stereotype threat (versus no-threat) or a performance-avoidance goal (versus no goal) alone led to decreased math performance. However, inducing both stereotype threat and a performance-avoidance goal increased women’s performance and challenge appraisals. These findings are consistent with the theory of regulatory fit. Performance and challenge appraisals increased when there was a fit between the motivation associated with stereotype threat (avoid failure) and the induced goal (avoid performing worse than others). Implications for stereotype threat, achievement goals and regulatory focus theories are discussed."
978,Where Will the Next Generation of Publishers Come From?,A. Baverstock,Journal of Scholarly Publishing,"This essay considers how publishing (the concept and the associated industry) is understood within society and how to spread understanding of both the processes involved and the job opportunities available. It examines traditional publishing recruitment practices and the skills and competencies sought. It considers the role of publishing within the academy, its arrival and reception, and how this is changing as more sector-specific research is published. It looks at course content on an international basis, how this matches the skills likely to be needed by future publishers, and the role of the work placement. Finally, it examines the process of widening and diversifying recruitment, as well as the practical measures being taken to assist in this process. The author makes a series of recommendations on how to spread understanding of the publishing industry and present it as an attractive option to the future workforce; promote a move to meet the needs of a wider cross-section of society through encouraging more people to read and gain the quantified benefits thereof; prioritize excellence in information management and dissemination; and spread the habit of buying published resources beyond traditional markets."
979,Which criteria to prioritize the healthcare problems to be treated through the Integrated Care Pathways?: Antonio Giulio de Belvis,A. Belvis;A. Visnijc;A. Izzi;S. Bucci;M. Tanzariello,European Journal of Public Health,"BackgroundAn Integrated Care Pathway (ICP), also known as Care or Clinical or Critical Pathway is a multidisciplinary care plans which detail the essential steps of a specific clinical problem. The introduction of ICPs in healthcare organizations should provide better healthcare to patients and reduce unnecessary variations in practice. While there is a huge literature on definition, design and managing of an ICP, criteria to select the health problems are lacking. Therefore we aimed to define those prioritization criteria useful to define ICPs in healthcare organizations in Europe.MethodsA systematic review was performed in Pubmed, Scopus, CINHAL and Medline web search databases, using a Boolean search by the following mesh terms and free text word: clinical pathway, critical pathway, integrated care pathway, health priority, health problem, health issue and plan. The Delphi technique, as a structured process using a series of questionnaires to gather information, held until group consensus is reached, was applied to select and validate criteria useful for ICPs’ health problems selection.ResultsBecause no articles, dealing with ICP prioritization criteria, were found, a second review was performed, focusing on priority setting of health interventions as a whole. 32 of the 327 articles resulting from the second review were included. Several criteria dealing with different dimensions (eg. feasibility, health distribution, health level, responsiveness, social and financial risk protection) were identified. Then, a Delphi panel, composed by European experts on ICPs implementation, was established. Preliminary results suggest that high priority should be assigned to health care problems characterized by a high need/demand volumes, wired evidences available, social and technological pressure, debate on literature.ConclusionsAgainst the growing interest in ICPs implementation as suitable tools to minimize delays and resource utilization and to maximize quality of care, no universal criteria useful to prioritize and plan ICPs implementation in healthcare organizations are available. Our framework, composed by dimensions, criteria and weights, should assist healthcare organizations’ decision makers in planning activities and resource allocation.Key messagesSelection of health problems to be faced through ICPs implementation should be guided by several validated and shared criteria in order to ensure a better answer to health problems.Priority setting in a comprehensive ICP selection has policy implications on resources allocation, strategic planning and overall governance and management, with undoubted effects on equality, too."
980,Why Have We Been More Successful in Reducing Tobacco Use Than Violent Crime?,A. Biglan;T. Taylor,American Journal of Community Psychology,"Tobacco control efforts have been associated with a significant reduction in the prevalence of tobacco use in the United States. Efforts to reduce the incidence of violent crime have been much less successful. This paper argues that progress on tobacco control stems from the existence of a clear, empirically based, and widely understood analysis of the tobacco problem that articulates (a) the harms associated with its use, (b) the causes of tobacco use, and (c) the programs and policies that could reduce tobacco use. This analysis has guided the development of a network of social organizations that have been advocating for policies and programs that are reducing tobacco use. In contrast, there is not a widely shared, cogent, and empirically based analysis of the problem of violent crime. As a result, efforts to combat violent crime are fragmented and it has proven difficult to generate support for preventive programs and policies. Substantial empirical progress has been made, however, on how violent crime could be prevented. That evidence is reviewed. It is argued that the articulation of this evidence is a critical first step for achieving widespread reduction in the incidence of violent crime. Communication of that evidence to audiences that matter will require that behavioral scientists become better organized to advocate for the adoption of empirically supported practices."
981,Why do deep convolutional networks generalize so poorly to small image transformations?,A. Azulay;Y. Weiss,ArXiv Computer Science,"Deep convolutional network architectures are often assumed to guarantee generalization for small image translations and deformations. In this paper we show that modern CNNs (VGG16, ResNet50, and InceptionResNetV2) can drastically change their output when an image is translated in the image plane by a few pixels, and that this failure of generalization also happens with other realistic small image transformations. Furthermore, the deeper the network the more we see these failures to generalize. We show that these failures are related to the fact that the architecture of modern CNNs ignores the classical sampling theorem so that generalization is not guaranteed. We also show that biases in the statistics of commonly used image datasets makes it unlikely that CNNs will learn to be invariant to these transformations. Taken together our results suggest that the performance of CNNs in object recognition falls far short of the generalization capabilities of humans."
982,Why do nanowires grow vertically-aligned in the absence of epitaxy,A. Azulay;Y. Turkulets;D. Gaudio;R. Goldman;I. Shalish,ArXiv Physics,"Images of uniform and upright nanowires are fascinating, but often, they are quite puzzling, when epitaxial templating from the substrate is clearly absent. Here, we reveal one such hidden growth guidance mechanism through a specific example - the case of ZnO nanowires grown on silicon oxide and glass. We show how electric fields exerted by the insulating substrate may be manipulated through the surface charge to define the orientation of the nanowires. Our results suggest that the growth of wurtzite semiconductors may often be described as a process of electric-charge-induced self assembly."
983,Why some people do not use Facebook?,A. Aloudat;O. Al-Shamaileh;K. Michael,Social Network Analysis and Mining,"Facebook is the most pervasive social network in the world. While, we would commonly expect everyone who has access to the Internet to use Facebook, some people have chosen not to join or to opt-out of its services. This qualitative study is an effort to understand the justifications that drive their decision. Based on in-depth semi-structured interviews, several recurring reasons were identified for Facebook non-use. Some results obtained are truly consistent with previous research. These include perceived security issues and safety risks, absence of trust, privacy concerns, influence of important others, lack of control, uselessness, availability of alternatives, lack of interest, and inappropriate content. However, some findings, such as one’s attitude toward the Facebook company and online social connectedness, diverge from previously published work. There is also enough evidence in the results to support the existence of additional contributing reasons for the rejection of Facebook that have not been directly reported before. These include religious beliefs, influence of culture, and a concern toward one’s information being available online: a point that we do put forward for further inquiry."
984,Wireless World 2020: Radio Interface Challenges and Technology Enablers,A. Alexiou,IEEE Vehicular Technology Magazine,"Future pervasive communication system requirements for two to three orders of magnitude capacity improvement, flexible, fast deployment, and cost/energy efficiency are expected to revolutionize the way we design and use wireless networks. From a network infrastructure perspective, the emphasis is placed on achieving ubiquitous, real-time high data rate communications ?anytime-anywhere,? including at cell-edge, through Small Cell Network architectures and Heterogeneous Cellular Networks (HetNets). From a pervasive systems? perspective, the vision of the Internet of Things suggests the integration between ubiquitous computing and wireless communications targeting a reliable connectivity of things, i.e., computers, sensors, and everyday objects equipped with transceivers. From a backhaul bandwidth, network resource sharing, and optimization perspective, cloud-based processing and radio access network virtualization provide a revolutionary approach toward balancing the degree of centralization of physical and virtual resources management. In this article we analyze these three trends, present key technology enablers, and assess suitable performance merits in an effort to set the scene for the wireless evolution in the era beyond 2020."
985,"Women's interpretations of the right to legal abortion in Mexico City: citizenship, experience and clientelism",A. Amuchástegui;E. Flores,Citizenship Studies,"In April 2007, after a period of intense social debate, the Mexico City Legal Assembly legalized abortion during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, which was an unprecedented development in women's rights in Mexico. Within the context of a proliferation of public discourses about women's citizenship rights changes in women's social status in Mexico, this article explores the extent to which the newly legalized character of abortion is interpreted by women as a right. Drawing on 24 interviews with women who had a legal termination of pregnancy between 2008 and 2009, this research shows that legalization opens up new and complex relationships between women as subjects of rights and the state. Such relationships are expressed as three discursive figures: legal abortion (1) as a concession from the government, (2) as ‘excessive’ tolerance by the state, and (3) as a right to be protected and guaranteed. The analysis shows that women's interpretations of the right to legal abortion are mediated by profound transformations, which Mexican society is currently undergoing. These include changes related to a shift from a clientist political culture to one more framed in terms of citizenship, the subjective effects of family planning policies, and their ambivalent relationships with Catholic notions of women and motherhood, and the effects of feminist discourses of women's citizenship, abortion, and reproductive rights."
986,"Women's words, women's bodies: late nineteenth century English feminisms in the ‘Interview’ column of the Women's Penny Paper/Woman's Herald (Oct. 27, 1888–Apr. 23, 1892)",A. Alexiou,Women's History Review,"Historians have written extensively on early twentieth-century British women’s suffrage, and late nineteenth century feminisms. Nevertheless, there is still an insufficiency in studies that attend to the textual and visual contents of late nineteenth century feminist periodicals. Non-mainstream periodicals produced by women for women allow us to explore distinctive hybrid modes of gender. They also offer us exclusive access into the everyday experiences, and individual thoughts of actual late nineteenth century women. This article focuses on women’s interviews and portraits published in the Women’s Penny Paper/Women’s Herald, demonstrating that they often combined traditional with more radical emergent signifiers of womanhood in written and pictorial form. This is a journey into the verbal and non-verbal messages communicated through women’s words and bodies, expanding our collective archaeological project of reinterpreting the past from women’s point of view, and the manner in which New Women utilised their choice of words and appearance to gain power."
987,Word Translation Without Parallel Data,A. Conneau;G. Lample;M. Ranzato;L. Denoyer;H. Jégou,ArXiv Computer Science,"State-of-the-art methods for learning cross-lingual word embeddings have relied on bilingual dictionaries or parallel corpora. Recent studies showed that the need for parallel data supervision can be alleviated with character-level information. While these methods showed encouraging results, they are not on par with their supervised counterparts and are limited to pairs of languages sharing a common alphabet. In this work, we show that we can build a bilingual dictionary between two languages without using any parallel corpora, by aligning monolingual word embedding spaces in an unsupervised way. Without using any character information, our model even outperforms existing supervised methods on cross-lingual tasks for some language pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that our method works very well also for distant language pairs, like English-Russian or English-Chinese. We finally describe experiments on the English-Esperanto low-resource language pair, on which there only exists a limited amount of parallel data, to show the potential impact of our method in fully unsupervised machine translation. Our code, embeddings and dictionaries are publicly available."
988,Work design for airport security officers: Effects of rest break schedules and adaptable automation,A. Chavaillaz;A. Schwaninger;S. Michel;J. Sauer,Applied Ergonomics,"This study investigated whether there is empirical support for the current EU regulation mandating breaks of at least 10 min after each period of 20 min continuously reviewing X-ray images in airport security screening. As a second goal, it examined whether providing more autonomy to airport security officers (in the form of spontaneous rest breaks and adaptable automation) would improve their performance and subjective state. Seventy-two student participants had to indicate the presence (or absence) of a threat item (either a gun or a knife) in a series of grey-scaled X-ray images of cabin baggage. Three work-rest schedules were examined: spontaneous breaks (i.e. participants could take breaks at any time), two 5-min breaks and two 10-min breaks during a 1-h testing session. Furthermore, half of the participants were assisted in their task by an adaptable support system offering three levels of automation: (1) no support, (2) cues indicating the presence of a potential threat item, and (3) cues indicating the exact location of a potential threat item. Results showed no performance differences between break regimes, which suggests that there may be viable alternatives to the current EU regulations. It also emerged that providing participants with adaptable automation did not lead to better detection performance but resulted in a less positive response bias than participants without automatic support. Implications for current aviation security regulations are discussed."
989,XNLI: Evaluating Cross-lingual Sentence Representations,A. Conneau;G. Lample;R. Rinott;A. Williams;S. Bowman;H. Schwenk;V. Stoyanov,ArXiv Computer Science,"State-of-the-art natural language processing systems rely on supervision in the form of annotated data to learn competent models. These models are generally trained on data in a single language (usually English), and cannot be directly used beyond that language. Since collecting data in every language is not realistic, there has been a growing interest in cross-lingual language understanding (XLU) and low-resource cross-language transfer. In this work, we construct an evaluation set for XLU by extending the development and test sets of the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus (MultiNLI) to 15 languages, including low-resource languages such as Swahili and Urdu. We hope that our dataset, dubbed XNLI, will catalyze research in cross-lingual sentence understanding by providing an informative standard evaluation task. In addition, we provide several baselines for multilingual sentence understanding, including two based on machine translation systems, and two that use parallel data to train aligned multilingual bag-of-words and LSTM encoders. We find that XNLI represents a practical and challenging evaluation suite, and that directly translating the test data yields the best performance among available baselines."
990,Xylem parenchyma cells deliver the H2O2 necessary for lignification in differentiating xylem vessels,A. Barceló,Planta,"Lignification in Zinnia elegans L. stems is characterized by a burst in the production of H2O2, the apparent fate of which is to be used by xylem peroxidases for the polymerization of p-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols into lignins. A search for the sites of H2O2 production in the differentiating xylem of Z. elegans stems by the simultaneous use of optical (bright field, polarized light and epi-polarization) and electron-microscope tools revealed that H2O2 is produced on the outer-face of the plasma membrane of both differentiating (living) thin-walled xylem cells and particular (non-lignifying) xylem parenchyma cells. From the production sites it diffuses to the differentiating (secondary cell wall-forming) and differentiated lignifying xylem vessels. H2O2 diffusion occurs mainly through the continuous cell wall space. Both the experimental data and the theoretical calculations suggest that H2O2 diffusion from the sites of production might not limit the rate of xylem cell wall lignification. It can be concluded that H2O2 is produced at the plasma membrane in differentiating (living) thin-walled xylem cells and xylem parenchyma cells associated to xylem vessels, and that it diffuses to adjacent secondary lignifying xylem vessels. The results strongly indicate that non-lignifying xylem parenchyma cells are the source of the H2O2 necessary for the polymerization of cinnamyl alcohols in the secondary cell wall of lignifying xylem vessels."
991,Zero-Voltage Switching Operation of Transformer Class-E Inverter at Any Coupling Coefficient,A. Ayachit;F. Corti;A. Reatti;M. Kazimierczuk,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics,"This paper presents a complete design methodology of a Class-E inverter with a loosely coupled transformer under zero-voltage switching conditions. At a selected maximum coupling coefficient, the inverter satisfies both zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and zero-derivative switching (ZDS) conditions to achieve a high efficiency. As the coupling coefficient is decreased from its maximum value to zero, the inverter satisfies the ZVS condition over a wide range of load resistance. The proposed method absorbs the magnetizing inductance and the leakage inductance into the inverter topology. The closed-form expressions for all the Class-E inverter parameters are derived in terms of the coupling coefficient, including: 1) input impedance of the transformer with a complex load impedance; 2) equivalent phase of the resonant circuit for both nominal and suboptimum operations; and 3) slope of the switch voltage waveform. The relationship between the voltage slope and the coupling coefficient is introduced, which indicates the proximity of the operating point from ZVS and ZDS conditions. A design example of the Class-E inverter is presented to achieve both ZVS and ZDS, at an optimum coupling coefficient of 0.77, and ZVS condition for any coupling coefficient lower than 0.77 and over a wide range of load resistance. Saber simulations and experimental results are given to validate the soft-switching capabilities over a wide range of the coupling coefficient and load resistance. The theoretical results were in good agreement with Saber simulations and experiments."
992,Zidovudine insertion in tailor-made propylene and ethylene oxide copolymers,A. Borreguero;M. Muñoz;J. Haro;M. Carmona;J. Rodríguez,Reactive and Functional Polymers,"A synthetic strategy has been developed to create tailor-made poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(propylene glycol) copolymers functionalized with alkynyl groups that are introduced into the co-polymer chains by the addition of glycidyl propargyl ether (GPE) as co-monomer. The alkynyl-decorated copolymer obtained is used as a starter material to synthesize a drug–copolymer conjugate by copper catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction (click reaction). This way, hydrophobic drugs can be transformed into water-soluble compounds by improving its absorbability and bioavailability by joining them to tailor-made PEG–PPG–GPE copolymers with low polydispersity and precise molecular weight. In this work, zidovudine (AZT) drug with an azide group was chosen to be attached to the polyether chain. The chemical structure of the copolymer was characterized using infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and gel permeation chromatography. Finally, 1H NMR spectrum confirms the successful addition of the zidovudine drug to the synthesized copolymer by the click reaction."

Eynatten;I. Dunkl;A. Gerdes,Journal of South American Earth Sciences,"In the forearc of the Central Andes of southern Peru, the Cenozoic Camaná Basin (16°25′S to 17°15′S) forms a ∼NW–SE elongated depression filled with coarse-grained deltaic and fluvial deposits. These deposits are termed Camaná Formation. We have applied for the first time, advanced multi-method analytical techniques to sediments of the Camaná Formation in order to define precise sedimentation ages, unravel sediment provenance, and to explain its tectono-sedimentary evolution.Zircon U–Pb geochronology and multiple geological evidences suggest that the Camaná Formation ranges in age from Late Oligocene to Late Miocene, and may even extend into the Pliocene. We propose a provenance model for the Camaná Formation based on U–Pb geochronology, heavy mineral analysis, and single-grain mineral chemistry by LA-ICP-MS. This model suggests that sediments of the lower part of the Camaná Formation derive from rocks forming the Coastal Cordillera (i.e. the Arequipa Massif and the San Nicolas Batholith) and the widespread ignimbrites of the ∼24–10 Ma Huaylillas volcanic arc. In contrast, sediments of the upper part of the Camaná Formation derive predominantly from rocks forming the Western Cordillera (i.e. the Arequipa Massif, the Tacaza Group, and the Coastal Batholith) and products of the ∼10–3 Ma Lower Barroso volcanic arc). Accordingly, we infer that uplift of the Coastal Cordillera has strongly influenced deposition of the Camaná Formation since Late Oligocene. A marked shift in provenance within the Camaná Formation at around Middle to Late Miocene time (14–12 Ma) suggests drastic uplift of the Western Cordillera at that time.

994,fcc antiferromagnetic Ising model in a uniform external field solved by mean-field theory,A. Beath;D. Ryan,Physical Review B,"The fcc antiferromagnetic Ising model with nearest-neighbor interactions in a uniform external field is studied using a simple mean-field theory, and a phase diagram is presented. Our theory is formulated in the spirit of a Weiss-like molecular field theory: Four spins forming a basic tetrahedron are allowed to fluctuate while the surrounding 28 spins take mean-field values. The phase diagram is similar to that obtained in the Bragg-Williams approximation for chemical ordering of Cu1−xAux alloys, although apart from the similar phase diagrams, the two theories give substantially different results. First, all of the detected transitions are correctly predicted to be first order. Second, we obtain two previously undetected reentrant phases. The existence of reentrant phases is discussed and we show that this ordering scenario is fully consistent with the results of the Bragg-Williams approximation which does not contain reentrant phases."
995,microRNA function in left–right neuronal asymmetry: perspectives from C. elegans,A. Alqadah;Y. Hsieh;C. Chuang,Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience,"Left–right asymmetry in anatomical structures and functions of the nervous system is present throughout the animal kingdom. For example, language centers are localized in the left side of the human brain, while spatial recognition functions are found in the right hemisphere in the majority of the population. Disruption of asymmetry in the nervous system is correlated with neurological disorders. Although anatomical and functional asymmetries are observed in mammalian nervous systems, it has been a challenge to identify the molecular basis of these asymmetries. C. elegans has emerged as a prime model organism to investigate molecular asymmetries in the nervous system, as it has been shown to display functional asymmetries clearly correlated to asymmetric distribution and regulation of biologically relevant molecules. Small non-coding RNAs have been recently implicated in various aspects of neural development. Here, we review cases in which microRNAs are crucial for establishing left–right asymmetries in the C. elegans nervous system. These studies may provide insight into how molecular and functional asymmetries are established in the human brain."

Quock,Brain Research,"The present study examined the co-expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and A5 regions of the mouse brainstem within several neurochemical populations involved in nociceptive modulation. Double immunohistochemical methods showed that nNOS+ neurons do not co-localize with serotonergic neurons within any of these regions. Within the RVM, the nuclei raphe magnus and gigantocellularis contain a population of nNOS+/GAD67+ neurons, and within the paragigantocellularis lateralis, there is a smaller population of nNOS+/CHAT+ neurons. Further, nNOS+ neurons overlap the region of expression of β-endorphinergic and met-enkephalinergic fibers within the RVM. No co-labeling was found within the A5 for any of these populations. These findings suggest that pain-modulatory serotonergic neurons within the brainstem do not directly produce nitric oxide (NO).

997,yellow-in-the-dark Mutants of Chlamydomonas Lack the CHLL Subunit of Light-Independent Protochlorophyllide Reductase,A. Cahoon;M. Timko,Plant Cell,"Light-independent protochlorophyllide reduction leading to chlorophyll formation in the dark requires both chloroplast and nuclear gene expression in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Mutations in any one of the plastid (chlL, chlN, and chlB) or nuclear (y-1 to y-10) genes required for this process result in the phenotype of the yellow-in-the-dark or y mutants. Analysis of the chlL, chlN, and chlB transcript levels in both light- and dark-grown wild-type and y mutant cells showed that the y mutations have no effect on the transcription of these plastid genes. Protein gel blot analysis showed that the CHLN and CHLB proteins are present in similar amounts in light- and dark-grown wild-type cells, whereas CHLL is present only in wild-type cells grown in the dark or at light intensities ≤15 μmol m–2 sec–1. Analysis of chlL transcript distribution on polysome profiles and rates of protein turnover in chloramphenicol-treated cells suggested that CHLL formation is most probably blocked at translation initiation or elongation. Furthermore, treatment of cells with metabolic inhibitors and uncouplers of photosynthetic electron transport showed that regulation of CHLL formation is linked to the physiologic status of the chloroplast. Similar to wild-type cells, y mutants contain nearly identical amounts of CHLN and CHLB when grown in either light or darkness. However, no CHLL is present in any of the y mutants except y-7, which contains an immunoreactive CHLL smaller than the expected size. Our findings indicate that CHLL translation is negatively photoregulated by the energy state or redox potential within the chloroplast in wild-type cells and that nuclear y genes are required for synthesis or accumulation of the CHLL protein."
998,ΔNp63α-Mediated Activation of Bone Morphogenetic Protein Signaling Governs Stem Cell Activity and Plasticity in Normal and Malignant Mammary Epithelial Cells,A. Balboni;J. Hutchinson;A. Decastro;P. Cherukuri;K. Liby;M. Sporn;G. Schwartz;W. Wells;L. Sempere;P. Yu;J. Direnzo,Cancer Research,"Genetic analysis of TP63 indicates that ΔNp63 isoforms are required for preservation of regenerative stasis within diverse epithelial tissues. In squamous carcinomas, TP63 is commonly amplified, and ΔNp63α confers a potent survival advantage. Genome-wide occupancy studies show that ΔNp63 promotes bidirectional target gene regulation by binding more than 5,000 sites throughout the genome; however, the subset of targets mediating discreet activities of TP63 remains unclear. We report that ΔNp63α activates bone morphogenic proteins (BMP) signaling by inducing the expression of BMP7. Immunohistochemical analysis indicates that hyperactivation of BMP signaling is common in human breast cancers, most notably in the basal molecular subtype, as well as in several mouse models of breast cancer. Suppression of BMP signaling in vitro with LDN193189, a small-molecule inhibitor of BMP type I receptor kinases, represses clonogenicity and diminishes the cancer stem cell–enriched ALDH1+ population. Importantly, LDN193189 blocks reconstitution of mixed ALDH1+/ALDH1− cultures indicating that BMP signaling may govern aspects of cellular plasticity within tumor hierarchies. These results show that BMP signaling enables reversion of committed populations to a stem-like state, potentially supporting progression and maintenance of tumorigenesis. Treatment of a mouse model of breast cancer with LDN193189 caused reduced expression of markers associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, in vivo limiting dilution analysis assays revealed that LDN193189 treatment suppressed tumor-initiating capacity and increased tumor latency. These studies support a model in which ΔNp63α-mediated activation of BMP signaling governs epithelial cell plasticity, EMT, and tumorigenicity during breast cancer initiation and progression.

999,α7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors on GABAergic Interneurons Evoke Dendritic and Somatic Inhibition of Hippocampal Neurons,A. Buhler;T. Dunwiddie,Journal of Neurophysiology,"GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus express high levels of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, but because of the diverse roles played by hippocampal interneurons, the impact of activation of these receptors on hippocampal output neurons (i.e., CA1 pyramidal cells) is unclear. Activation of hippocampal interneurons could directly inhibit pyramidal neuron activity but could also produce inhibition of other GABAergic cells leading to disinhibition of pyramidal cells. To characterize the inhibitory circuits activated by these receptors, exogenous acetylcholine was applied directly to CA1 interneurons in hippocampal slices, and the resulting postsynaptic responses were recorded from pyramidal neurons or interneurons. Inhibitory currents mediated by GABAA receptors were observed in 27/131 interneuron/pyramidal cell pairs, but no instances of disinhibition of spontaneous inhibitory events or GABAB receptor-mediated responses were observed. Two populations of bicuculline-sensitive GABAAreceptor-mediated currents could be distinguished based on their kinetics and amplitude. Anatomical reconstructions of the interneurons in a subset of connected pairs support the hypothesis that these two populations correspond to inhibitory synapses located either on the somata or dendrites of pyramidal cells. In 11 interneuron/interneuron cell pairs, one presynaptic neuron was observed that produced strong inhibitory currents in several nearby interneurons, suggesting that disinhibition of pyramidal neurons may also occur. All three types of inhibitory responses (somatic-pyramidal, dendritic-pyramidal, and interneuronal) were blocked by the α7 receptor-selective antagonist methyllycaconitine. These data suggest activation of these functionally distinct circuits by α7 receptors results in significant inhibition of both hippocampal pyramidal neurons as well as interneurons."
1000,‘I Had a Guilty Conscience Because I Wasn't Going to Marry Her’: Ethical Dilemmas for Mexican Men in their Sexual Relationships with Women,A. Amuchástegui;P. Aggleton,Sexualities,"In Mexico's predominantly Catholic culture, the enjoyment of sexual rights faces many challenges, both at the political and the personal level. Although often connected, the meanings of sexuality and reproduction are fundamentally different and so, correspondingly, are possibilities for the exercise of reproductive rights versus sexual rights. Such views are ‘gendered’ by the idea that women's desire and sexual activity should be controlled and men's masculinity should be affirmed through sexual performance. Drawing on in-depth research conducted among young Mexican men in rural communities, this article examines the ‘ethics’ implicit in men's accounts when talking about sexual desires, pleasures and practices with women. Findings point to the need for a stronger ethics of sexual citizenship in Mexico as part of enabling conditions for the exercise of both men's and women's sexual rights."
1001,‘What it means to be truly human’: The postsecular hack of mindfulness,A. Arat,Social Compass,"The present ubiquity of meditation represents the latest ripple in the easternisation of the West. The mindfulness movement in particular has emerged as a popular expression of this contemplative turn. The vast majority of scholarly work on this subject rests on the assumption that mindfulness represents the culmination of the traditional trajectory of secularisation. Drawing on a discourse-analytic study of how contemporary mindfulness is constructed and made meaningful however, this article argues that these developments point towards a new modality of the secular. While the surface language of mindfulness operates in complete discursive isolation from the religious, its ontological foundation is nevertheless found to rest on a claim towards a transcendent whole. In the final analysis, this post secular hack of mindfulness signals a sacralisation of the secular with significant implications for the sociology of religion.L’omniprésence actuelle de la méditation représente le dernier résultat de l’« orientalisation » de l’Ouest. Le mouvement de mindfulness en particulier, a émergé comme l’expression populaire de ce tournant contemplatif. La grande majorité des travaux d’érudition sur ce sujet repose sur l’hypothèse que le mindfulness représente le point culminant de la trajectoire traditionnelle de la sécularisation. Basé sur une analyse du discours sur la façon dont le mindfulness contemporain est construit et fait toutefois sens aujourd’hui, cet article démontre que ces développements pointent vers une nouvelle modalité du profane. Alors que le langage du mindfulness fonctionne dans un mode discursif autonome par rapport à celui du religieux, ses fondations ontologiques sont néanmoins basées sur une affirmation d’un tout transcendantal. Dans l’analyse finale, nous observons que l’ingérence postséculière opérée par le mindfulness témoigne d’une sacralisation du séculier, ce qui a des implications importantes pour la sociologie de la religion."
